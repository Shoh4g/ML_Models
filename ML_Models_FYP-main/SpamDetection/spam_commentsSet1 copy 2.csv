ham,The course is okay. lectures are boring but & the midterm exam questions are LIKE the tutorial & practice ones but are harder. so be prepared for that. the overall course feels pointless and as if it could've been done through a AFM191 chapter.
ham,Jeehae is perhaps one of the most caring prof in AFM. She makes sure you participate and her class is always fun to attend. I just don't like IT. The projects are annoying too. But you do learn a lot in this course in regards to IT audit and internal control. It's not a hard course.
ham,Good course. Great introduction to many different programing languages and query databases.with applications for business purposes. Pretty easy if you're interested in data analytics. Basic understanding of coding would be helpful. but not necessary. Handful of graded workshops. No midterm or final. instead three big projects (two group one individual).
ham,"This course really needs a preparatory course (which will hopefully soon be introduced) in GR notation, differential geometry, and so on, since a lot of material is compressed into 4 months and most students feel quite lost."
ham,"Very interesting course. very math heavy course too! The physics of General Relativity are introduced and taught well.
ham,Great 300 level course if you enjoy learning about anatomy.  Has 1 midterm. lab quizzes (really simple similar to BIOL 110). and a final. Midterm and final were all multiple choice.  Questions were straightforward majority coming from the course notes and a small portion from the textbook. Lots of memorization involved but that's to be expected considering it's an anatomy course.
ham,There is a lot of content in this course but if you're good at straight memorization then you'll be fine. The lab quizzes are quite easy if you study a little for them and the midterm was very fair. Overall its a time consuming course but you can get 90+ if you're willing to put the time/effort in.
ham,Weekly labs with quizzes are pretty annoying. You have to study at least an hour or two every week for the lab quizzes where you dissect a cat in a course called human anatomy. There is no textbook and course notes are scattered and disorganized.  Just a pure memorization course.
ham,"The concepts of this course were simple but it was pure memorization. Vivian is a b**** when it comes to spelling for her fill in the blank sections on the midterm and the final. If you buy into the mastering anatomy and do the 5 super simple quizzes you can get 5% of your final grade guaranteed. There was also a super short assignment involved easy to get 100 on. Midterm wasn't hard material just a lot remember and SPELLING!!!
ham,It was purely a lot of memorization on top of many courses I had to take during this term but the class was interesting with a super easy mid term but a harder final exam. All the material that was included in the test and the exam were fair material right out of her course notes and if you really have her notes memorized and a gist of all the diagrams provided you can easily get an 80+ in this course. The lab was super interesting and the quizzes were fairly easy as they only required you to study parts of your dissections during the lab itself (except the first two labs). And the lab exam was pretty fair of the things learnt in lab and the dissections which was worth 15% of the entire course! Overall it is a good course but wouldn't recommend if you're taking other courses which require a lot of memorization along with it!
ham,This is definitely a useful course to take!!! You will have to put in an effort for a good grade but besides the final exam the course is not stressful. The labs were actually enjoyable with oral quizzes at the end of each. This term mice a cow eye and sheep organs (e.g. heart) were dissected. Doing the MAP assignments option is recommended for a free 5%.
ham,Incredibly interesting and useful course. I don't recommend taking it unless you have a pretty solid math background though- the assignments will all be setting up differential equation models in class.
ham,"This course is amazing. I learned so much and all of it was directly applicable to the research I plan on doing.
ham,As a bio student this is the best AMATH course you can take. It will open your eyes to a new field in applied math and biology and it is amazing. However despite the prerequisite does not require any CS courses I would recommend you to know some basic scripting and CS logics before you come to this class - it will make your assignments so much easier
ham,The experiments were a bit more interesting than the fall counterpart. I liked them more. Although the course structure is identical to the CHEM 120L pretty much. Pre-lab quizzes and procedure summaries force you to read over and understand the key aspects of the experiment before entering the lab so you should already have a good idea of what you are doing. TAs are quite helpful and the professor is as well.
ham,Standard lab just like 120L. I'd recommend to start the labs early so that you can ask about certain things that aren't obvious. For example the first lab has some terms from Orgo that need to be defined and I lost marks by doing it the night before. Overall, lab was not that bad.
ham,It was more useful than CHEM 120L and actually had applications with the material worked on in class. The lab and course are not very well lined up though so it's really hard to do lab calculations  when you haven't learned how to do them in lecture. The reports were harder and so was the exam.
ham,Very similar to CHEM 120L. The problem was that CHEM123 and CHEM123L were not in sync and so we had to do equilibrium problems before we learned them in lecture. Sue does a good job of explaining how to do the problems in the lab manual, but it's a good idea to start them early so you can get help if needed. Lab report marking really depends on how picky your TA is. The experiments done were pretty fun! However the final was not fun because it was very calculation based and felt very long. It was hard because you had to know the methods for a lot of different types of calculations, and having both the CHEM 123 and CHEM 123L exams on the same day didn't help. It definitely brought a lot of marks down.
ham,"Labs were easy to do write up were about the same as 120L. Find out how strict your TA is in the first lab then decide all your writing on that (my TA would take 3 marks off for labels on graphs..).

ham,Very tedious lab reports, and your TA can make or break your mark on those. The exam was a slaughter. Required you to do  calculations on it which were longer than on the CHEM 123 exam. Much harder than the 120L exam. And it doesn't help that they make the 123 and 123L exams on the same day. :(
ham,"This course, just like CHEM 120L, was nicely structured. Sue is such a sweetheart and she will provide so many opportunities to boost up your marks. However, her lab tests are BRUTAL (and often times unfair). We are expected to be able to answer 40 questions (most of which are calculation based), in around 80 minutes.

Your performance, lab report wise, I think will depend on your TA. Attend your TAs office hours, as they will talk about their expectations for lab reports and such there. Do not hesitate to email your TAs or Sue, better to be safe then sorry, considering your lab report marks will carry you throughout the course."
ham,my opinion is that this course is just CHEM120L part 2. literally, sue set the course up the exact same way, so if you did well in CHEM120L you'll likely get a similar mark in this course. she makes the lab tests exceptionally difficult (and, as I've heard, in non-covid years the lab exams as well) so try and get as many marks as you can before that point. some labs may be difficult to understand, don't be afraid to ask sue or TAs for help though, they are mostly very nice and clear when explaining things to students.
ham,I think this course prepares students for future chemistry lab courses well. The course is well organized and the professor provides ample examples to illustrate why and how certain things work the way they do. However, the I felt that the TA quality was lower in comparison to CHEM120L.
ham,I took this course in Winter 2022 and I was really excited to be in a lab setting post-Covid. The experiments were fun and I was lucky to have a really good TA. He was very helpful and I had great marks on the lab reports and assignments. What annoyed me was final lab exam was worth 40% of my grade and the lab reports totalled 35%, so majority of my grade was going to be decided by the one exam, not the 5 reports I spent hours working hard on. It didn't help that I bombed the final even though every question seemed so simple. So after performing so well the whole semester the end killed my mark, which sucks but I'd say just preparing really well for the final is crucial.
ham,The experiments in this lab are much more straight forward than the experiments in chem 120L in my opinion. The post lab reports were not more difficult than the ones we had to do in chem 120L and there is no full lab report. Instead, there is a lab (experiment 4) that has a bunch of report sheets that are 99% calculations. That lab essentially murdered everyone taking the lab, especially those who had it in the first week. The content in the lab is taught in chem 123 lectures AFTER all the lab reports have been submitted, which made it difficult for everyone to complete the lab in the first place. Utilize the pre class videos for chem 123 lectures (module 4) to help you with this lab as after we learned the content in lecture, everything made so much more sense. The exam is not too terrible, its just tricky in some questions.
ham,thought this would be a continuation of chem 120l, but it was much harder. the labs itself werent that hard but the post lab reports (especially the titration and calorimetry lab) were very hard to calculate. the titration lab was done before the titration unit started in the chem 123 lecture, so u couldnt use anything u learned in class and apply it to the lab (which is the whole concept of the lab). i was lucky enough to get a very nice ta that marked easily and gave me tips on how to calculate them. the final exam prep had so many mistakes and wasnt even representative of the final exam, so doing that was a huge waste of time. wish the final exam prep was representative bc that final made my mark drop 13%. mark breakdown is the same as chem 120l.
ham,fun and interesting labs, many of the reviews said the exam is horrible, i think they are at the same level as the lecture exam, it's a fair exam with material from the manual, but because it's more calculation focused making it more time consuming.
ham,disappointed in myself because I worked so hard throughout the entire semester on my lab reports etc only to get a 57 on the exam and drop my entire mark by 12%. make sure to study hard for the exam and don't underestimate the fact that even though its a written lab exam, it WAS NOT EASY AT ALL. they didn't give us proper preparation for it whatsoever. the practice exam they gave us literally had 4 incorrect questions. The labs itself were fun to perform but the post-lab reports were GRUELING and took up so much of my time. it was basically another course with a full term of work to do. i understand that its a chemistry lab but holy, I hated the post lab reports so much that I dreaded having to study and redo them all over again for the exam which is probably why I didn't do as well as i wanted. moral of the story: if you want to do good, treat every lab report like its a life or death exam :D
ham,If you like multiple choice tests and are good at memorization this course will definitely be easy for you. Your mark is dedicated by 2 online quizzes (which you have 48 hours to complete), a midterm, and a final.
ham,"This is a pretty easy course. Consisted of 2 in-class tests and 2 online quizzes. Pure memorization, but not of annoyingly obscure facts though, he only tests you on important facts and concepts.  If you go to class, do the readings, and study at least a little bit, then this course shouldn't be too hard to do well (80+) in! If you suck at memorization though, then it may not be as easy."
ham,"3 in class tests worth 33% each, with each covering 1/3 of the course material (non-cumulative).
If you're interested in ancient Greek culture and society, this is such a worthwhile course. By far the most interesting content in any course I've taken."
ham,"Took this course with Dr. Lisa Trenton in Spring 2021 online due to COVID 19.
Marking scheme was 40% Term Tests (2 x 20 %), 20% Assignments (2 x 10%) and 40% Final Exam. The content is interesting and engaging as Dr. Tenton included podcasts and other resources. The textbook can be downloaded for free. The Term Tests are based mostly on lecture material and include text book material. The Term Tests include MC, FIB and Long Answer questions. The assignments are based on comparing movies like 300 with ancient sources. The final exam was completely long answer with NO MC. Overall, finished with a high 90. Not as easy as CLAS 104 and this course requires more time. It is hard to get perfect on the two assignments, but the term tests and final exam are quite easy."
ham,i would highly recommend taking clas 100 first. this course overlaps quite a lot with clas 100, it gives you a super basic overview of several parts of ancient greece although the tests (of which there were three) were difficult. they were very long tests and some of the questions expected you to know things that were not elaborated on or even taught in class. having clas 100 under your belt will give you the knowledge needed to fill in the gaps left in this course, and pass the tests. readings were also dense, the textbook ('classics in translation') is from the 1950s, they were long readings and you read herodotus, aeschylus, thucydides, plutarch, etc. but the subject matter itself is interesting, especially if you already have an interest in ancient greece.
ham,My favourite CS course at Waterloo. Lectures were horrible and extremely dry. The midterm should have been really simple (had I studied properly...), but the final was quite a bit more difficult. Overall, I really enjoyed the material and was pretty impressed with how much more interesting logic is than math (CS 245 >>> Math 135)
ham,The material is quite dry. Lot of theory-based stuff which I didn't really like. A lot of the proofs for theorems were quite unnecessary in the course as you'll most probably not understand them and if you did, you're going to forget them in a couple of weeks/months anyway. It did teach a lot of logic stuff which could be kind-of helpful for future courses. I expected some programming but there was not a single line of code.
ham,"Wasn't such a bad course this term. The content for propositional logic was pretty interesting actually. Course started ramping up at predicate logic, and got pretty boring honestly. I don't really care about soundness and completeness.

Though if I had to compare this with MATH 135, this course is definitely better. The proofs you do aren't really the same nature, so if you hated 135 then at least this course isn't any worse."
ham,Not a good course. very hard. It is completely useless/boring/pointless for CS people. Midterm was very bad but the final was OK. I narrowly passed. Keep up to date with the lecutures and try to understand the concepts thoroughly and you can do it.
ham,I was in the enriched section and the entire time I thought I didn't actually understand what I was doing and thought I would get a low mark, but then ended up with a 100%. For at least the enriched section  the tests are way easier than the assignments and class examples.
ham,An interesting and easy course. assignments didn't take too long and the proofs (from resolution to natural deduction to program verification) were like fun little puzzles. Keep up with the assignments and you will do fine :)
ham,The course itself was pretty simple - they'd define a method to solve a set of problems, you memorize said method and apply it. Not very interesting or useful, there were only a few things we learned that I actually could appreciate and see the usefulness of, like program verification and some stuff on code simplification.
ham,I took the enriched section of the course with Prof. Ragde. I can't say much about it since it's still a curriculum in dev. We did a lot of programming however, which is not something the standard sections usually do.
ham,"The material COULD be interesting. The course was one of the most horribly taught I've ever seen. I went from a 59 to an 80 on the midterm after being remarked. We were literally NOT TAUGHT something on the midterm.

Just try not to fail, because then you'll have to do it again."
ham,Fuck this course. If you want to take it in an easy term, make sure Trefler is teaching it. There will be no solutions provided for the midterm/final/assignments, and none are provided to the markers. You can write a bunch of bullshit on the page and get an easy pass without learning jack shit. Just make sure your bullshit is sensible and has random words that have been said in the course.
ham,"Worst course in Waterloo. should be removed completely. The difficulty picks up fast after the midterm.


I ended up submitting remarks for 9/11 (no pun intended) assignments cause markers will just take off marks for anything."
ham,Not extremely easy but definitely easy for a CS course. The assignments are super useful and are pretty much all that's needed to do well on the midterm and finals. The content is interesting but not really applicable. A major downside is that often what is asked to do is not really understood but rather just memorized in order to be able to regurgitate it. Careful at referring to previous years though because the curriculum is always changing.
ham,The course was pretty simple throughout the term. Some of the assignment proofs were fairly challenging, but they were enjoyable to complete. Towards the end the course got a bit more grindy, with program verification and whatnot, but overall a good course if you ignore its usefulness.
ham,Took the enriched version. From what my friends in the non-enriched version were doing, this was not a mistake. The enriched version really brings an appreciation for strongly typed programming languages, and the power of a type system.
ham,Terribly organized, with big inconsistencies from prof to prof. The material in theory should be exactly the kind of thing I'm into, but the amount of poorly-defined course-specific terminology really threw me off.
ham,"Taking the course during covid (F20), its not well organized by the profs, the content is moderately uninteresting (maybe that's just me), and the profs don't seems to care about applications (understandable if its a math course, but this is ""CS""245)"
ham,"Online Course: Lectures are painfully short videos x 100, notes are slide PDFs with all the extra animation slides (they couldn't be bothered to take them out), and they updated A1 on LEARN two times after releasing it without making announcements to the class, only a reply to a question thread on Piazza (which isn't even the A1 official post).

This review is from the beginning of week 2. Pray for us"
ham,Terribly organized, had to teach myself the whole course. While the concepts aren't too difficult, there was no adherence to deadlines, course materials were all over the place spread across 5-10 separate slideshows every week. No information was given about our final until the very beginning of final season. Overall, don't take it online if you don't have to unless youre confident in teaching yourself everything and doing it on an unknown and tight schedule
ham,"This course is not all that bad if I am being objective. The content for propositional and predicate logic is actually interesting. Things do somewhat go off the rails with Peano Axioms and Program Verification. The main issue with this course - mainly just for this term (and potentially next term) - was the disorganization. The slides were quite long, and also quite dull in terms of explanations. Some had very few (useful) examples, and others had nothing but examples. The only ""lectures"" we had were a few short 2-5 minute videos about particular slides where they typically just went over the example on the slide, or maybe added in some additional information for said slide. I felt the course lacked effective explanations due to the medium for communication, which actually made our midterms and final somewhat difficult. The proofs in this course actually weren't all that bad, and to an extent I would argue were easier than Math 135. I guess it was because they were much more focused in terms of content, and not as abstract as 135. Just remember... YouTube is your friend!"
ham,A very poorly run course (took it during covid-19) with assignment questions that are both stupid and easy (stupid, because it's not rewarding, easy, because it's straight from the slides). The exams were a bit more difficult but still trivially easy (except maybe formal deductions). The course content must be revamped since the slides are notoriously long.
ham,Although this course is overall useless, I enjoy the part where I actually designed a turning machine. Also, the course is relatively easy, and most people I know are about to ace the course (I predict I will get a 96 or something)
ham,"This course makes 0 sense. Every lesson is a poorly explained 100+ page long pdf.

There was a lesson that was 80 pages that didn't make sense and was better explained by a single Wikipedia picture.

Everyone I know gave up on trying to understand the course after the midterm. 

Details about the final exam were on a follow-up comment to a buried Piazza post of someone who asked for the details (wasn't even pinned).

1/2 way through the final exam they start posting about critical errors in the exam questions."
ham,There are some useful concepts, like proving whether some program works or not, and the stuff with Turing machines, but so much stuff was useless in my opinion. Also exceptionally hard for no reason. Must attend office hours or doing the assignments is not really possible unless you are amazing at proofs.
ham,"Great course. Excellent lecture materials, which have no mistakes in them. Instructors are very responsive on piazza. Assignments are reflective of examples presented in tutorials and slides. Timed midterm and final exam was easier than untimed weeklong assisgnments.
The final exam especially was trivially easy compared to everything else in the course.................. 

Jkjk, everything I said above in the opposite order. The final exam was brutal, my mark dropped by 7-8 percent. I got hit by the BUSS."
ham,Not as easy as I have heard. Went in expecting a breeze but got hit hard by the Buss like the other commenters. However, if you study well and respect the difficulty of the course (unlike me) you should get high grade. I can't really see how learning this material would help me in my future CS courses or in the industry. I saw this course as nothing more but a required course needed to complete for my degree. Although the section on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem did intrigued me enough to watched Veritasium's video on it, this course sometimes felt like a waste of time to me.
ham,I took this course only during the pandemic. It is poorly organized and the assignment and test questions are either very easy, or extremely difficult. This is defiantly a borderline Math course as 95% of the course revolves around proofs. Personally I dislike most of the contents taught in this course (the Turing machine part is a bit more interesting, but the assignment question is on a different scale compared to what was taught), but I think it is because of the way this course is taught. Each week there can be up to 200 or more slides to read and the lecture videos barely covers any contents. The course becomes boring and exhausting. This is the hardest CS course I have taken so far and I suggest taking it in person if possible.
ham,No one likes this course. It's unnecesarily complicated and tedious for students. The instructors lacked any enthusiasm for the content. 3 marking TAs left for some unknown reason as well. I really don't think anyone likes this course.
ham,Like some other reviewers said, you need to respect the difficultly of this course. In hindsight, if you study well, go to office hours for assignments, and really ensure that you understand each new topic introduced, you should do reasonably well.
ham,The most difficult and disappointing course I've taken so far in my undergrad. The content is taught poorly with a lack of examples and insights that truly reflect the difficulty and intuition present on the written assignments and assessments. The only way you're going to get a high grade in this course is if you let it become a time sink - allocating many hours per assignment, going to every office hour, and going to every tutorial. However, this course isn't even that relevant for many students pursuing a CS degree here. The fact this course needs to become a time sink if you want to do well is a testimony alone to not just how poorly taught this course is, but how poorly designed this course is.
ham,"The worst course I have taken at Waterloo so far. The course wasn't bad because of its content or difficulty. The reason why this course was so terrible was because of its delivery. Students had to read between 100-150 slides from a powerpoint each week. Reading text from 100 uninteresting slides is just painful.

I found the course difficult at first because the slides made the simplest concepts hard to understand. I already knew a few of the CS245 topics before this course and I still had a difficult time figuring out what the slides were trying to say. 

The course got much easier after I gave up on the slides and started googling videos and articles to learn from instead. 

I did take this course during the pandemic, so hopefully it will be a little better in person."
ham,"Surprisingly difficult course due to the style of delivery. Really sharp escalation in difficulty in assignments, and midterm was unexpectedly difficult. The proof methods used were a little hard to get used to, and the biweekly assignments actually took a while. Overall caught me by surprise for a course that was just supposed to be tedious.

Big shoutout to prof. Roberts for having the best office hr and being patient despite some very very interruptive questions from certain students."
ham,This class is like you took MATH 135, and threw it in a blender, along with a bunch of other new concepts. A lot of the material presented seemed pretty interesting, however useless. Also, the first half of the course with propositional and first order logic was not too hard. However, everything after that was really hard to understand, like turing machines, and weird formal deduction proofs. Also, the instructors did not respond often to Piazza questions and gave very vauge answers oftentimes (usually just yes/no answers). I do have to give a shoutout to professor Kari, as her lectures and commentary were really fun and were honestly my main motivation for getting through this course.
ham,"Took it online and it was the worst course I've taken in my life. With 100+ poorly organized slides to read per week (alternatively, you could watch someone read off the slides word-by-word at 30 words per minute), the content delivery was abysmal. The content itself was sometimes interesting (particularly Turing Machines & program verification in Week 12/13) but brain-numbingly boring for the most part and insanely useless, which made the course 3 times harder (most people had 0 motivation for this useless course). The course staff were also just as useless as the content, Crowdmark assignments usually didn't have any feedback and  marks were deducted for no reason whatsoever. While Zihao Wang responded to each Piazza post very quickly, his answers were useless cause 99% of the time because he didn't care to understand the question and just wanted to type something in the instructor answer. In summary, this course was a huge waste of time and the delivery was terrible (course staff sucked). My one piece of advice is to study hard for the exams as they were very difficult timewise. Good luck. Update: You'll need the content in CS245 for CS251 and CS241 so make sure you're learning."
ham,Pretty awful course. The content is kind of interesting but useless, and the assignments are not too difficult once you do some practice and properly go over the slides. Tutorials/Office hours can be very helpful if you go to the right person, some of them are literal bots, but others are extremely helpful like Pablo and Dheeraj. BUT THE EXAMS ARE SO HARD. The questions are similar to assignments but 10x harder and longer. Final tore me a new one.
ham,took it with Jonathan Buss (aka the Worst Prof at Uwaterloo). since it is a required course for CS students, don't waste your time taking the course with Jonathan Buss, instead take it with some other prof.
ham,Incredibly boring and dry course. If it weren't for Professor Alice Gao's online notes and problem sets, this would have been a lost cause. Midterm was easy and the class did super well, and so they made the final ridiculously long and difficult to pull down the average. They succeeded :(
ham,I had Jonathan Buss. Man put me to sleep in every lecture, no matter how hard I tried to pay attention. If you have Pablo's office hours, definitely attend them, they are so helpful for the assignments!! Pablo is the reason I passed this course, not Buss and his multitude of slides.
ham,"My first mark below 90 in a cs course. The profs could not be more monotone (worse than Brian Forrest). I got a 92 on the midterm and a 70 something on the final. Ended with an 86. I have not heard a single person say anything good about this course, but I'm going to go against the grain and say that the first half (formal logic) was pretty easy and interesting. The second half, though (turing machines and undecidability) made no sense.

Don't see how this class is useful at all, though."
ham,UW CS's way of overkill-preparing you for writing if-statements at your co-op. Starts out easy with MATH 135 review but ramps up significantly. Logical equivalences, formal deduction will kill your brain, and by the end of it you'll eat De Morgan's laws for breakfast. 3hrs of videos a week during COVID that I played on 2.5x speed while hugging my stuffed dolphin and crying into it because it was so boring.
ham,"the course notes and lectures are horrendous for this course. notes were all slides which are like 50% filler. the lectures just involved prof reading those same ""course notes"". i even like writing proofs but the course is so difficult to get through on account of being so bloated and boring. its not even hard its just presented poorly"
ham,"""The first half of the course is trivial"", or so I heard. Picking up concepts is kind of difficult at times, because the course content sometimes makes you try to do the assignments without knowing exactly how concepts should be applied. It takes some practice getting used to it, but once you look at tutorial examples and slides things do start to clear up."
ham,The course material is not as bad as I thought, it is fun and I like to spend some time solving those questions. The on-campus course is really boring, and tedious, but the slides that Lila Kari made were clear and engaging.
ham,The topics are really really cool, but it is ruined by the course organization. Profs had an average Piazza response time of 3 days(!!!), and the assignments were heinously long. The type of thing I want to talk about but not do ever again.
ham,Topics and concepts are really cool and fun, especially if you're more math oriented. That being said the course is pretty hard and heavy, less than CS 246 but comparable nonetheless. I stopped going to lectures because the course slides give a better explanation, office hours are pretty useless, and they don't give any practice or anything like that. Would be a way better course if they had better organization and gave practice problems but fun nonetheless.
ham,Content was generally enjoyable, and the course really relies on knowing the content covered in the past as stuff builds up quite a bit. If you did all the assignments, you were more or less prepared for the exams, even if the assignments were very long. Was the course sound and complete? No. But was it fun and had cool ideas to take away? Yes!
ham,A lot of this course is just practicing the proof techniques. For things like formal deduction, peano arithmetic, etc. there isn't a systematic way to approach every proof, you really just need to get creative and hope for the best, which is why I thought this course was pretty hard. Not to mention that we'd never use anything in this course ever...
ham,Honestly the content isn't really useful for CS, but I found it pretty interesting stuff. Designing Turing machines was fun and formal deduction was kinda like a puzzle (think of djao's Coq but not as good). Slides had a lot of filler but you could skip lectures easily enough, there were basically just a few core ideas in the course presented in different ways, so if you make sure to understand them you'll do fine. Pretty disorganized.
ham,The content is unique and has a lot of potential to be made into a very interesting course. Unfortunately this course does not present it well at all. The lectures are dry, the slides are dry, and the course focused way too much on the most uninteresting parts, like formal deduction. It just felt like they kept over formalizing everything to the point where you couldn't be interested in the content anymore. Not to mention the profs took an abysmal amount of time to respond to questions on Piazza, with inactivity for up to a WEEK at one point.
ham,The lecture slides have so much filler content. To study for exams, do the tutorial questions and any extra practice. Assignments are a bit tough sometimes, but still manageable. Quizzes are free marks. This course didn't teach anything useful, its just a measure of how much you can study and memorize arbitrary concepts. Questions were kind of similar to MATH 135.
ham,Almost a pure theory course that was pretty interesting and easy if that is your kind of thing. If not, I can see how it is quite dry and boring. For the most part, assignments are very easy, the midterm was fair, although the class picked up in the last third, which was where I found it the most challenging. Final was also quite hard.
ham,Took online F21. Such a dogshit course, concepts were disconnected, midterm and final were so difficult for the given time, and almost 0 communication b/w students and course staff. The concepts themselves weren't even necessarily complicated but the course delivery was so disorganized and unclear the course became needlessly hard. Very useless course, but some interesting stuff was there.
ham,"This course was made terrible by Shai Ben-David.

Lectures were extremely unorganized.
No slides were provided, only uploaded handwritten notes with many typos - days after the original lecture.
2 weeks worth of lectures were cancelled to accomodate the professor's schedule.
Prof also plagarized some content directly from a professor at York University and changed nothing, except replacing their name.
Assignments took 1 month to grade.
Students completed the final with 2 assignments still ungraded.
The majority of assignment solution had typos, but regrade requests were rarely answered.
Told students beforehand that ""formal proofs"" were not testable, then proceeded to test them on the CS245 midterm.
Resulted in many students failing, even with a curve.
Also used completely different notation on exams than content covered in class, leading students to believe those were also plagarized.
Tried to violate the official course outline, until students submitted a grievance to the associate dean.

Avoid if possible"
ham,"CS 245 was hell, a huge part of it because of the professor, Shai Ben-David.

Shai was by far the worst prof I have encountered in my undergraduate career... or in fact, any teacher/ professor/ lecturer I have ever encountered in my whole life, before and during university.

He is:
- Disorganized. Never posts anything unless we nag him many times, and is all over the place on Piazza. His notes are also really disorganized and all over the place.
- Has policies (ie. -10% per day late) that the class does not know unless we ask him, students have to convey to other students policies over piazza as he does not announce them.
- ignored all Piazza questions the week before the midterm, a lot of questions throughout the term and the period before the final.
- Often does not provide helpful response at all on piazza, when he actually responds.
- would often respond to items MONTHS later being like ""this is already released""... yes it is now, but it was not at the time.
- Disappears for days on end, ignoring our questions regarding when assignments will be released (on some occasions, he released assignments over a week later than he promised!).
- told our class he would make typed notes or slides, took forever to do and only grabbed them from another professor, and only did it for a small subset of the course after repeated nagging.
- Does not release practice solutions for midterm questions.
- TA's don't provide helpful response either.
- Makes assignments due after the formal lecture period (not permitted technically).
- changed the syllabus halfway through the term (not permitted), was passive aggressive to students when responding to complaints about this. A grievance with the associate dean had to be filed to fix this.
- Cancelled a lecture and promised a makeup video by the next day, took 4 days to post, and just grabbed an old one from YouTube.
-Told us formal proofs were not on the exam, and then the day before told us it was. There was also great confusion to what was actually on the final exam.
-Assignments are released over a month after they were due, A4 and A5 are not out, even after exams.
-Students had to nag him repeatedly for the final exam formula sheet.
- Repeatedly does not follow up on what he promised us, Unhelpful in general, source of great frustration.
-Teaches us the same content as 245E despite not being a enriched offering.


The most important thing I learned about this course was how to crowdsource help outside of class in understanding fundamental course concepts due to the MIA prof, as well as how to learn concepts on my own. Anger management training was also embedded in the course due to how severely mismanaged it was.


The fellow students were great though, and helped me get through the course and understand fundamental course concepts.

I initially enrolled in this course in a previous semester, and regret severely not finishing itÉ The course might be bad normally, but Shai took it to whole new shitness level.

I feel bad for the people who had to take a INC to write a exam this semester, as what is taught this term is completely different from the previous terms."
ham,This course builds on what you learnt in MATH 135. The proofs and code verification are boring, but I liked the practical connections to real life that our prof talked about. Like, the potential consequences of not verifying your code, that was fun. Go to lectures and you'll be fine.
ham,"Not super interesting. A lot of the content is review from MATH 135 (predicates, truth tables, etc), except that you delve deep into the basic theory which is quite boring and cumbersome.
The content was less interesting because it was taught by Shai-Ben David, see professor review.
Exams were hell and material grading was inconsistent, but this was also due to professor."
ham,Pretty interesting stuff - kind of like MATH 135 but I liked this better, less proofs/inductions... Surprisingly I really enjoyed this even though I didn't do very well! SO MANY THANKS TO KRIS - he made the course content so clear and engaging I was shocked. Both midterm and final were fair, but I messed up the final because I kept making mistakes and spent way too much time mending it.
ham,I thought this course was good, but many of the topics seem like things I've already gone through in my undergrad career. It's probably because I took it in 4B, though, so I already had some work terms and courses that covered some of the things this course touched upon.
ham,I was excited for this course, but at least this offering of the course was pretty terrible. What is talked about in lectures does not match the slides which does not match what is covered on the assignments. Theory covered either seems irrelevant or Wikipediable. I heard its been the same course content from 10 years ago. Everyone I talk to this term has similar opinions. Would not recommend.
ham,This course will touch upon everything you did in a CS degree, especially if you took courses like security and networks before. I didn't really enjoy it because you jump from topic to topic, sometimes with very little connection. There are a lot of details unanswered and the textbook is limited in it's use. In terms of assignments, 2 of them will take up quite a lot of your time.
ham,"2 written assignments and 2 implementation assignments, and final. No midterm. Written assignments were like 50/50 knowledge questions and basic proofs of distributed computing concepts. Implementation assignments were lengthy, requiring multiple weeks to finish. You have to start early or you might get fked. The first one was not too hard once you understood the pattern, since it was kind of just fill in the blanks. The second one was much harder since you had to actually figure out how to implement functions for a distributed file system. The assignment description was 30+ pages on its own.

For the final the prof gave out a bunch of questions that were more or less the exam questions, so it was really helpful to go to class for that."
ham,The course was basically one big coding assignment and the final. Expect to take 20+ hours for the coding assignment, it is definitely not easy. The course itself covers many high level topics that are useful for SWEs. I personally found them very interesting.
ham,"This course is interesting in the sense that the topics covered are relevant, but the course programming assignment is very much disconnected from the rest of the content. The assignment only relies on two lectures but is worth 40% of the grade. More importantly, it's a cumulative assignment without tutorials, so 1 bug can literally kill your assignment mark. The written assignments are pretty simple but can be a little unclear, as they require you to look in the textbook (not really a problem) or do your own research.

I would take this course if you're super passionate, but otherwise, there are way better courses to take. I would honestly take this course if they had tutorials to go over assignment details."
ham,Content wise, it was nothing too in depth, but a high level overview of how distributed systems worked, very much theoretical, but interesting. Outline was 4 assingments, and a final. It was mainly a3 that was a bit of a time sink, so make sure to get started early. It's more the debugging aspect that takes time, than the actual implementation. A2 was trivial once you figure out the basic implementation of a single call (the rest are all minor changes). A1 and a4 were pretty straightforward written assignments based on things discussed in class. No midterm so that was fun, but there was lots of stuff to cover for the final. If you're taking the course with Khuzaima, make sure to attend every single lecture, extra points if you audio record it for future use. Also, he basically gives the major exam topics for the final in the last lecture, so definitely attend that and focus on getting those topics revised first. Lastly, office hours were very useful for assignments, make sure to attend if you're stuck. The TAs are knowledgeable and helpful!
ham,"Assignments are stupid, and have nothing to do with course material. First assignment was a 400 word essay on a news article about fossils. Second assignment is a group project: ""Pick a fossil or group of fossils in the Earth Sciences Museum.  Produce an education product that might be professional quality and suitable for use and disseminated to the general public."" Seriously..."
ham,"* Unclear explanations (prof gets lost in the math equations)
* Hard midterm/exam (didn't match previous years or what we learned in class)
* Never got marks back until the end of the term (so we didn't know how well/terrible we were doing)."
ham,While this course does NOT need ECE316 as a pre-req, the amount of the probability  involved in this course would make you question yourself so much that eventually you would give up on this course. The most difficult course I've ever taken in my past 5 years of university. DON'T take this course unless you are ready for dry concepts and boring derivations. This course DOESN'T teach you how to do real image processing at all.
ham,I had never done statistics before. I liked this course. I found it to be interesting. Most of it was pretty easy too. The assignments had some hard questions, but overall it was pretty good. The course material was enjoyable.
ham,I learned some interesting stuff. Unfortunately I took this course at a time where I was not willing to put too much effort into it, causing me to fall behind. Once you fall behind, it's really hard to catch back up.
ham,The course is a good introductory statistics course but the professor's delivery was extremely monotone. Would like to point out this could be because this was the first fully online fall term and the lectures were recorded.
ham,Pr easy but depends on your prof. My class had to buy two books and do hella assignments but i know my friend only had to a few assignments and no mandatory books. Fairly easy if you stay on top of your work and pay attention to the rubric for assignments. I got a 90 in the course with a bit of effort.
ham,(Learned this remotely due to COVID). This course is so useful to anyone looking to become a researcher or scientist in the future as it teaches you how to communicate scientific research. However, my professor was so unnecessarily strict on grading the assignments by nitpicking every little thing. I had many other science courses to complete, so I didn't have the time to do the discussion boards worth a good chunk of marks, and I rushed and got them completed at the end ( minimum 250 words each). There were so many lectures that I did not have the time to watch. I could not get a 90% on the major annotated bibliography/ report/ presentation/ poster assignments even though they were all well-done, given the workload I had. I would always get really high marks on these types of assignments in high school, and I was doing the best I could. My professor literally wanted every little thing to be perfect, but I couldn't realistically make my work that high-quality due to my course load, I'm still surprised I even got those assignments done in the first place...
ham,I took this course remotely with Brad and he was really great. he set the course up to have just 4 assignments ~20-25% each. i would say i dedicated 1-2 hours per assignment and with medium effort got mid-80's marks. the course is actually kinda useful, you learn some things which may be relevant if you wanna work in research and it was a fun break from the other hard courses that i was taking. all in all not a bad course and actually pretty informative.
ham,"This course required us to buy a textbook just for a few articles that the professor definitely could have found online for free (and provided us with the links). If these articles were not available for free online, the professor should have chosen articles that were freely available. Some links were included in the syllabus but these never led directly to articles, only databases of articles (and as a result were not helpful).
Overall, I very much did not enjoy this class, nor did I feel that I learned much from it. The disorganized, chaotic, and vague nature of the course materials and instructions caused me a great deal of stress particularly about completing assignments to a satisfactory standard. I dreaded working on this course partially because of that stress but also because I found the material boring and many of the articles were hard to read. I did not feel that I learned anything that I hadnÕt learned from high school or even grade school and I also feel that the most important science communication skills that we need for our undergraduate degree is being taught in our lab classes with lab reports. "
ham,One of my only classes that had discussions so it was nice for socializing. Tbh you dont need to buy the textbook for this course either or even do the readings lol - a lot of the discussions were opinions or u could just skim the articles and speak on what u read.
ham,I hate english class but this course was different and actually taught me a lot about rhetorical strategies in science communication. This course seems to vary wildly on what instructor you have but with a little bit of effort its easy to pass with flying colours.
ham,"Liked this course, can be tedious at times but the main thing is teaches is to effectively read scientific literature, which is useful to any science student. Its also an opportunity to improve your writing skills.
"
ham,Super helpful course - it wasn't structured traditionally like any other courses I've taken (ie. a professor lectures for an hour and a half while students mindlessly write down everything they say) and because of that I feel I learned a lot more without actually realizing how much I learned and gained from this course.
ham,This course is absolutely useless. It is a complete regurgitation of content from AP Lang, I learned nothing that can benefit me in the future. We didn't go over ways to improve lab reports, how to apply to jobs (resume skills or writing cover letters), or anything remotely relating to communication in science.
ham,Good course for those looking to pursue the sciences. Best advice would be to take the attendance seriously, and be sure to consistently submit the required work on time. Otherwise it will slowly chip away at your work.
ham,This course is actually so troll. Like it's completely useless and I don't think I learned anything of importance that I'll take with me in the future. Prof had adhd or something because he would always go on tangents and we'd never cover anything in class. And if we did, he wouldn't make it obvious. Like there were so many times where he'd pull up a slide show and just start talking, but you wouldn't know that was the lesson until he referred to it as a lecture later on. He's a nice dude and he knows what he's doing, but he just can't manage time well and he kept cancelling things that we were supposed to do in class because we ran out of time. That was fine with me because less work, but it just shows his teaching methods... need improvement. Idk, the course was fine but I personally hated it and it was a complete use of time. Oh also, the TA will mark every single thing that you hand in, so if you get a hard marker, you're so screwed. To put it in perspective, I got a 98% in 4U english in high school, and I got high 70s on my final project. I'm just super mad at this course and it's def bringing my average down, but it's fine :) Just bs everything and you'll be fine :)))))))
ham,I wouldn't recommend taking this course with Carter Neal. I mean he's a nice guy but you'll have to spend your money on 2 books you'll barely need to read and write multiple journals and long essay as a project. Some other profs don't have any required books and don't assign any lengthy writing assessments. The course overall wasn't difficult but not very useful either.
ham,Somewhat useful content in terms of the scientific communication aspects, but all the APA talk was repetitive. Otherwise, I particularly loved how my prof Ashley Irwin handled the course. If you have her I HIGHLY recommend participating in class discussions (worth 10%) because no matter what you say she will love your contribution and make you feel welcomed and included. She was the only prof I ever met as a first year in this uni that actually cared about her student's mental health and well-being. She literally spent an entire class talking to us and giving us advice on how to deal with exam stress because we voiced our concerns to her about our other courses. She also tries to make every lecture engaging and due to the small class size, it really helped me make new friends and feel less isolated (reminded me of high school). In my opinion, her course structure was the best when I compared it to my friends who were also in ENGL 193 but with different profs. We only had 4 major assignments spread throughout the semester, one of which was a group lab report (we didn't have to present anything in front of the class which was super nice). Her marking was fair and she remembers those students who participate in class often and rewards them with slightly easier marking compared to those who do not. She was also lenient with deadlines if we had a valid reason. We didn't have to write journal entries or write our thoughts about random scientific articles (only discussed them verbally in class, therefore no homework!). Overall, really good course I was so close to getting a 90 but due to the group project, I dropped a bit. Still high 80s tho so can't complain. If you are able to choose your prof and fit her class into your schedule, CHOOSE IRWIN TRUST ME!
ham,Annoying mandatory class participation.  Not at all difficult, but the content is pretty boring.  Quizzes in class were questions basically straight out of the homework, as was the final exam.  Only about 5-6 types of problems to solve in the entire course.
ham,Loved this course from top to bottom! Phonetics, phonology, morphology, and syntax were all very fascinating. Do some practice problems, make sure you go to class (prof explains things really clearly) and you'll be fine. Good background for CS/software people interested in NLU and speech processing
ham,Course difficulty will vary among professors. I took it with Sara Humphreys. I did not have much to take home from the lectures, and the assigned work felt made the course feel like a very upper year / graduate studies course. Dropped and retook it online with Randy Harris and not only was the course assignment less painful, I also learned more and had a very enjoyable time.
ham,"Really interesting course! Despite not being exposed to much Linguistics before (and gaining a rather venomous hatred for highschool English), I ended up loving the class! Assessments were fair, this was one of the few courses I've taken where it felt like assignments and tests weren't just for evaluation, but also for learning. 10/10 would recommend. (Taken online)"
ham,Liked the variety of concepts covered. Was not too much work, there was usually something assigned at the end of class but those activities were always small. I know the phonics stuff just doesn't 'click' for some people, but I found it interesting and fun (plus it's only one of several units).
ham,Does take time if you have Afros since she basically forces you to go to lectures or watch the 2 hour recorded lectures on the platform that doesn't let you speed up videos :(. Basically no lecture notes so if you're a textbook learner like me, it'll be harder. Nonetheless an interesting course.
ham,Pretty cool english course- we don't write essays like your standard ENGL courses but instead we learn about words and sentences in a very systematic way. People who are more technically inclined (comp sci, math) would naturally do very well in this course.
ham,So very interesting. I did well I think. Makes you learn so much about English Phonetics and Linguistics. Classes were at SJU, which I preferred over Hagey Hall or something. Also, the other person who said this course can be made use of in NLP...... pleeeeeeeease I took your words too seriously
ham,Great course, linguistics is very very interesting but it's not easy. It requires some deep thinking but once you learn the gist of it it'll be useful in so many different situations. I can imagine this course being very difficult depending on the professor you have. You'll learn a whole new vocabulary in this course. For the first half of the course I felt like I was learning a new language, there were so many terms I didn't know. Overall I really enjoyed it. I think you can get a good mark in this course if you're mathematically minded
ham,I took this course online over my co-op term for my List C CSE requirement.  This course gave me so many new perspectives on the English language and other languages in general.  Not only was the course super interesting and insightful, but it was useful too.  I'm willing to say that learning the linguistic features of a language will elevate your fluency in that language.  In terms of difficulty, the workload for this course is decent, but it will definitely be easier to learn the concepts in this course if you're logically minded and know how to use your resources.
ham,Interesting material but not presented in a great order. Quizzes are given on stuff you have to read in the textbook then prof lecture on the material after the quiz is due. Also doesn't expand on the topics so lectures are useless except to get the Iclicker marks
ham,"The labs are the best part of this course. Being outside is refreshing change from traditional courses. The lecture component is very different from the lab though and there is a disconnect between the material of the two. Take this course in the Spring if you can - the labs are so much fun (minus the mosquitos). You need to buy the textbook though for the online quizzes. Beware of buying the online version though as it can be difficult to flip through sections of the book when completing quizzes.
If you like nature and want to know more about how ecosystems work - take this course. It is not a bird course though since the lab report due is a lot of work. Do the first lab (you pick 1/3) and your life will be much easier since the 3rd lab is due at the end of the term when you will have many other assignments due."
ham,Both engaging for people who know quite a bit about ecology already, but beginners won't get swept away either. The labs are very much like that as well. Lab tend not to relate very strongly to the lecture, but that's not necessarily something bad about the course.
ham,If you're an outdoor person you will like the lab. TAs are hard markers in terms of lab report. However, just read the textbook in details, because the midterm and final ask for details in the text. A lot of textbook reading.
ham,The content of this course is pretty useless. You have to go to lectures to answer clicker questions, and you essentially have to self-teach yourself the entire course with the textbook. There is a lot of material to memorize for the exam, which covers things you learned from the lab as well.
ham,This course is probably the hardest planning course you'll take second year, and it is the most useless. Lecture attendance is mandatory because of the iclicker questions, and so is purchasing the textbook. I found this to be a waste of time and money because you literally have to read the chapter over the weekend to do the weekly quiz, just so the prof can teach you what you already read.  It is very difficult to do well in because there's SO MUCH memorization, and depending on your TAs they can be very difficult markers. Some TAs were very anal and unapproachable which made this course unenjoyable for a lot of people.
ham,Hated this course with a passion. There are weekly quizzes, weekly readings, 3-hour labs, lab exercises,  lab report (draft and final), clickers, midterm, and final. There is also so much memorization involved, when none of it actually appears on the exam.It's important to realize that we have four other courses to focus on aside from this course and that our life doesn't revolve around ENVS 200. If you like ecology, then take it. If not, don't, the course is literal hell with terrible TAs (except Kyle and the safety TA Dani).
ham,The course was fine, not particularly interesting but lectures were good, well-taught. Just make sure you go get your lab report reviewed by the TAs before submitting since they are very specific about what they want to see in it. Also the textbook really helped for the midterms and exam, but the exam questions were very specific and picky about what the TA SAID during the labs, etc.
ham,Overall great introductory course to ecology, though textbook reading can be a little hefty (but necessary because of weekly reading quizzes). The TAs were helpful, however the lab report assignments (split into 4 sections) are all graded by the Head/Admin TA who graded quite harshly for the first few assignments. Nevertheless, had fun!
ham,"Tough exams.!!! The course is very environmental which includes a lot of onsite field trips. But I would say the course's midterm, quiz, and final were not as easy as lectures. The lectures are easy and interesting. BUT Final and midterms are really difficult. The final many students can't finish all questiosn in time. It feels like you were taught ""1+1"" but you were tested "" square root of 29530"" without calculator. Multiple choices each one got 5 long selection which is pretty stressful to do like 40 MC and 10short answers and 10fill in blanks. I would not say it's a easy course."
ham,If you are remotely interested in field work this is a great course to take. The labs are easy but involve hands-on work outdoors. For ERS students it's usually taken in the winter term tho which kinda sucks cause it's cold for the outdoor labs.
ham,This course really gives you a base understanding of Ecology in a way that is very engaging. You get to do labs and go outside and the work is fairly straight forward. One midterm and one exam 23% each so it does take up a big part of your grade but as long as you have a good work ethic it is manageable and fun.
ham,really fun course! the grading scheme is nice too - the 2 tests are not extremely difficult but they do require you to study a lot. the prof is also a very energetic person, her lectures never feel boring or out of touch
ham,great course! gives a good basis of ecology with interesting labs, except it's kinda tough in the winter and tiring at the end of the day. if you can, take it in the summer. Christine is also really nice and engaging.
ham,Naturally, this course depends on what you're looking for. As a planning student - even one who enjoys the outdoors and ecology - this foundation of ecological knowledge did not connect to my interests. A lot of the labs were a ton of fun - going out to Sponge Lake or dredging in the river - and the TAs are great, but I recall the tests were quite difficult, labs were mandatory to attend (and often early in the morning), and overall not a ton was gained.
ham,Plenty of class time to finish projects, if you use your time wisely. I especially enjoyed how open-ended the projects were, which gave a ton of freedom with your ideas and the art you want to make. Because of this, your assignments are generally as challenging as you want them to be.
ham,The content in this course is fairly easy to grasp, I took it online and there were discussion posts you had to make every week or other week I forget, and had to reply to someone (this was 20%). Along with some other nice and easy assignments to do. Would recommend taking.
ham,Extremely bird course. Most markables are pass/fail and many people including myself are entering the final assignment with a 95%+ course grade. I found that none of the modules or readings applied to the assignments which made doing them rather questionable. If you want a course that takes 5 minutes per week (1 discussion, 1 reply) then take this! If you want a course with material that applies to assignments and feels coherently built upon week to week... I would skip this course. Nice class overall if you have a busy term and want to spend no time on it.
ham,Bird course with no final exam! Interesting if you want to learn more on how the environment impacts health. The course consists of weekly discussions, and 2 major assignments which are pretty easy. Spent less than an hour a week on this course, easy 90.
ham,This course is super easy! Its a relatively small class (around 15 people) and you get marks from participating in  class discussions, two presentations, a take home final (essay) and weekly reading quizzes. It does require a fair bit of reading and if you're shy just be aware that it is discussion based. Prof. Rasmussen is very nice and a VERY easy marker. Overall it was a fun course.
ham,"Took it online. Thought it was a bird course, but there's so much reading and writing. Needed 4 separate books, participation in discussion forums. Only good thing is that there's no final (40% final essay instead, yay...).

I also didn't find it that interesting since there was more emphasis on learning about the Vikings from different perspectives than there was on what they actually did. I was kind of expecting to just learn about major events, people, etc. but having come this far I can't even name one notable historical figure I actually learned much about."
ham,I really liked the content of the course as it really caused you to think deeply about different issues and presented new perspectives on things. Textbook required, very long readings from textbook. Graded work had short group written assignments each week, online open book quizzes and one larger paper. Quizzes and written assignments were not too difficult but the paper really depended on your TA and if they agreed with your topic. By the end I found the whole class to be getting a little repetitive because it seemed to go on and on.
ham,I enjoyed this course quite a bit! I originally took it for an easy elective but I ended up finding it really interesting and enjoyable. There's a decent amount of reading(although it's doable to read it all the day before the tests) but that's basically the only outside work you have to do, plus all the books can be found online, as well as spark notes, so it really isn't too bad.
ham,This was an interesting course but very content heavy. You'll find a lot of similarities between modules and you need to know the differences in adaptations and responses in various types of exercise.  There were no assignments or quizzes so you need to study a lot for both the midterm and exam. Chris keeps things interesting and simple, I definitely recommend consistently attending the lectures.
ham,"very interesting class. Actually looked forward to learning the topics and applying it to real life scenarios.
However my professor, Keith Regehr did not seem very caring or engaging with the students. "
ham,Ended the course with a low 90. Super interesting course with engaging material. Very content heavy though so if your course load is heavy, not the best pick. Found it manageable though as the content was so interesting.
ham,Took this course online with Keith Regehr. Too many different kinds of assessments made it difficult to actually learn and study the course material. Even though the course material and readings were useful, with so many assessments, I was focused mainly on passing with a good grade than absorbing the information.
ham,"I took this course online/in-person in W22 with Allison Chenier. Course breakdown was: 3 reading assignments (10% each = 30% total), take-home midterm (30%), and final paper (40%). Online/in-person lectures consisted of Dr. Chenier giving a presentation on the week's topic (ppt slides posted on LEARN). There were required readings each week (anywhere between 1-6 articles) - imo not all of them are really ""required"" but you do want to keep up with most of them to use for the course assignments. Questions for the midterm and final paper were provided in advance. The course covers a range of topics related to criminal justice policy including selective criminalization, special marginalized populations in Canada, restorative justice, etc."
ham,Standard calculus course, meaning that it was pretty bland, black-and-white math. Mostly review from high school with the exception of integrals (unless you were in IB, AP, or some other advanced magnet program in high school). Mid-term is usually set to be somewhat difficult, but the exam is usually easier as a result.
ham,Awful course since I hate math, but one of those you had to get through. Keep ontop of due dates for assignments and do the questions in the textbook for extra help. Sometimes TAs have no idea what they are saying though.
ham,About half of the course was somewhat review from high school pre-calculus, so the midterm was relatively easy. A lot of the newer content was covered in the second-half of the course but it shouldn't be difficult if you keep up with the assigned work!
ham,I failed this course, lol. The assignments were really hard and I was way too stressed with adjusting to university this term -- maybe if I took it later on and actually knew how to manage my time, it would've gone better, but as it stands this class was hell for me. I should also add that I suck at math. If you're good at math, you'll probably be fine.
ham,If you took calculus in high school this should be pretty straight foward course as you the only new stuff are probably like (implicit differentiation, L'hopitals, related rates, linear approximation and introduction into very basic integration) depending on your high school curriculum..
ham,"When I took this course there were like 9 quizzes, 10 minute ""time limit"" during tutorials worth 40% of the final (only started W15, don't know if they kept it like this) but they were fairly easy. Do enough practice problems until you feel confident with the material. For the midterm/final they expect you to have some understanding of the theorems, and a strong understanding for rules/application type questions."
ham,Basic Calculus course, the first half of the course should be stuff you already know. Even if you don't, the course itself was pretty easy, exams included. The midterm wasn't too difficult but they made the final easier anyways. Also, don't let the insane assignments they give you affect your opinion on the course. They're only worth 1% each, the exams are what really matter in this course, and it's not even close.
ham,This course runs too slow in the beginning, covering things like limits and basic derivatives much too extensively. Then it speeds rather quickly through the stuff that counts- complex derivatives, integration, and their applications. Over-all good content. Difficulty really depends on how good your prof is, and how much time you are willing to put in.
ham,I came from a standpoint of having taken calculus in high school (including integrals) so for me this was almost entirely a review. But if you pay attention to the examples given in class, do all the homework, or look for other example questions online or something, you'll be okay. The exams were harder than any of the homework and practice questions though.
ham,This course was alright once you got the hang of it. I was not too confident about calculus coming into the course, but afterwards I did very well on the exam. I can only recommend practice with this course to do well in it. Also, the weekly quizzes were annoying but doing the assignments well ahead of time ensures that you have a good grasp on the material and that means it'll be fine.
ham,This course is extremely fast paced. However, the quizes are fairly easy. It is possible to achieve above a 90% in this course if you keep up with the material and seek help as soon as you fail to understand a concept.
ham,This is a review and extension of highschool calculus, and if I had kept up with practice questions it probably would have been a lot easier. Strive to understand what you're doing rather than just memorizing exercises and problems!
ham,Coming from a bio student that hates math and did really poorly in it in high school and couldn't get their grade above a 60 the entire term, the exam is really easy as long as you study. The weighting is so exam heavy (especially if they drop your midterm) that your grade can easily jump up 20-30% if you do well on the exam (I finished with a mid 80). Do the textbook work and assignments and you should be alright. Tutorials are pointless, TA's don't know what they're doing. Profs aren't any better. Study groups are key to your success  if you don't know what you're doing.
ham,Very similar to highschool calc if you did that. Basic. Only do integration in the last couple of weeks. You need to go to class in order to find out their expectations. Exam is straight forward. Tutorial is snooze fest, bring other school work to do.
ham,Basic calc course, going to class isn't necessary as long as you stay on top of assigned questions and the worksheets. Quizzes can be difficult if you haven't kept up on the workload. This is not an average boosting class, would not recommend taking it if it's not required.
ham,Not even hard if you pay attention in class, mid-term was meh but they didn't count it if you did better on the final.  5 Bi-Weekly quizzes that were very straightforward and the final is literally the exact same format as the practice finals they give you.
ham,i like math, not a big fan of my proff, the work i found to be fun and relatively easy. need to work hard before midterm and exam. midterm went very bad, exam was fair. quizes are relatively easy after looking back at them, just lots of little mistakes everywhere
ham,Lot's of high school review with some added information. I have never been a fan of math courses, but Brian Ingalls definitely made it more bearable. Tutorials go over practice problems with TA's and are usually uploaded to learn, so I never went. Easy to get over 80.
ham,Took the in-class version. 5% mini assignments, 10% biweekly assignments, 15% projects (should be a free 30% at this point), 25% midterm, 45% exam (becomes 70% if better than midterm). Also, they let us bring cheat sheets to midterm and exam. Midterm was easy, exam was kind of hard. Based on the generous marking scheme, it shouldn't be terribly difficult to get a decent mark. They definitely made the course easier compared to previous years, from what I've heard.
ham,About a month of highschool review (functions) and the rest was derivatives and a bit of integration. If you took AP Calc. in highschool, this should be very easy for you. If you haven't done integration before, it's important to learn and understand it when it's taught to you in class, because you will do more of it in MATH 128. *Highly* recommend taking this course with Paul McGrath or Owen Woody. I had Paul for 127 and Owen for 128 and both did an incredible job teaching the content, plus they are the course coordinators. Make sure to do the Mobius assignments for the free marks. They are sometimes frustrating / annoying to do, but hang in there! If you keep on top of your work, it is easy to get a good mark. :) They are also incredibly kind to us in this course, because we could make our own cheat sheet for the midterm and final, and were allowed to use any calculator that wasn't able to do derivatives or integration (didn't have to be faculty approved ie pink tie, blue goggles, etc.).
ham,"Took this course online. Owen Woody and Paul McGrath did a reasonable job with the online lessons --- though sometimes the examples go into more detail than necessary in my opinion (when strapped for time, use the formulas from the lessons (view the lessons in slide mode -- button in top right) and do the online mini - and bigger - assignments). Do all the little online homework assignments, the cumulative effect is enormously important to learning the material and the grades add up. No midterms, two ""Crowdmark Assignments"" which serve as take-home tests instead. The final exam is, unfortunately, worth 50% of your grade, this really pulled my grade down (they gave good practice problems in preparation for the exam, but I tend to make lots of silly mistakes in math.)"
ham,"having done AP calculus in high school, this course should have been a breeze, but i was surprised as to the fact that is wasn't as easy as i thought it would be. content wise, it covers all the functions done in high school, limits and derivatives, and an intro into integration. the midterm was quite hard and the profs had to propose an alternate grading scheme to help students from a poor performance, which had an average in the 60s. florian girelli is great at explaining concepts and makes sure his students know what typical ""traps"" students normally fall in on midterms and exams and how to avoid them. however, he does go quite fast in the notes and it seems as if you are expected to know the content before hand, but not everyone does. he does have a lot of clicker questions in the lecture to practice the math. the final was fair and if you practice the final exams given from previous years, it is very similar to those."
ham,Easy course. I found the entire course review of Grade 12 Math and Calculus. I know that for Ontario students didn't learn Integrals so the last month-ish will be a little harder for you but people who have done integrals y'all good.
ham,This course was really easy and light aside from the assignments and projects. There wasn't a midterm or final but that was because it was made into an online course due to COVID so I'm sure it'll be different once things get back to normal. Overall, there were just a bunch of quizzes at the end of each lesson and bi-weekly assignments with limitless attempts which, were to help make sure you understood the lectures. There was also a practise midterm to test yourself and a journal to keep yourself on track. Overall the course was pretty easy as it was just a repeat of grade 12 calc with one additional unit on integrals at the very end. The online video lectures, however, were almost incomprehensible. It took so long to understand, your better off referring to free textbooks online or searching up concepts on youtube. I only used this for the integral lecture but if you didn't take calc in grade 12 you should probably make sure to do so just to ensure you understand concepts completely. The projects were a little tricky but the prof replies pretty quickly during office hours with hints and tips on how to approach the question. Everything was pretty enjoyable except for the video lectures.
ham,If you took Advanced Functions and Calculus in high school, this course is an exact repeat except you learn integrals at the end. If you took AP Calculus, you learn more in high school calc than you do in this course. The midterm is a little tough, but the rest of the course is a breeze. The final exam was easier for me than the midterm.
ham,I wouldn't worry too much about this course lol. First two units are basically gr 11 functions and gr 12 advanced functions, 3 & 4 are gr 12 calc and 5 is the only new concept which is integration. i wouldn't even say it's that bad. just study before the tests, but if you know how to do limits and derivatives you'll probably be fine.
ham,Took this course online due to COVID-19. MATH 127 starts off with very simple content by first covering the basics of functions, which should've been covered in grade 11. It then moves into limits and derivatives which is covered in grade 12. Finally, the course ends with integration, which should be the only new topic that is presented in the course. Essentially, around 3/4 of this course is covered in high school with a little more toughness in the test questions. I personally found this course to be on the easier side but it gets confusing at the end of the term with the new integration content. A few tips for this course is to do the practice midterm and exam problems that are provided, it is highly likely that a question or two from the practice problem sheet may show up on an assessment, or a question very similar. Attend office hours if you are confused. University math can be a big jump for people and topics can be hard to understand, which is why asking your professor/TA is the best option to clear up any confusion and will only benefit you in the end. Overall, this is a useful course and is relatively easy to begin with. It will prepare you for what you should expect in MATH 128, if you take that course.
ham,(COVID-19/ remote learning expŽrience:) This course is essentially grade 12 calculus along with integrals at the end. The content is taught at the university level, so don't expect highschool-level explanations. The lectures involved more rigorous definitions and more involved problems than you would expect in a high school course. If you got 95% in grade 12 calculus, you pretty much know all the concepts and only need to worry about developing your skills further with this course. Integrals are not in the Ontario curriculum, but if you have time over the summer, you can definitely teach it to yourself by searching waterloo's free OpenCourseWare with this link: https://courseware.cemc.uwaterloo.ca/
ham,if youre getting like a 60 in first year just finish with it and get it over with if you really need it, first year isnt really looked at for grad schools anyways. class doesnt really teach you anything you learn online with mobius. the class average was kinda sucky but it is what it is.
ham,Taking the course right now and it is pretty difficult. The content itself seems easy and understandable, but when you have to complete the tutorial quizzes it's the opposite. Mobius lessons and actual lessons aren't the best for studying for the tutorial quizzes, you have to do some of the optional textbook questions and extra practice problems if you want to decent on the quizzes. This course was more difficult than I expected.
ham,Took this as a lifesci psych student in my 1A term, and ended up having to withdraw from the class as it was so difficult. Loved Paul, he really wants to help his students & is a really nice guy, but the course content was very difficult, even as someone who had high 90s in high school calc & functions.
ham,Lectures were useless and thereÕs really not a lot of resources available to help study within the course other than the textbook and the Ôpractice testsÕ. They were generous with the grading schemes, changing it throughout the course as the averages plummeted. ItÕs basically learn on your own unless you win the prof lottery.
ham,I am not good at math but I did pretty well in this course thanks to my instructor. The content builds well off of high school calculus and connections were regularly made to how these concepts would help us going forward in science.
ham,Calculus is definitely not easy however, my biggest recommendation is to take it online with Fiona Dunbar. I was in the in-person section and it was definitely going to be a lot harder than the online version which is why I switched to taking it online. The final was only worth 24% and the course notes and videos she provided made a lot more sense. Take Math 127 Online!!!!
ham,If you see Dan Wolczuk as an option, PICK HIM (unless he's at 8AM, rip q.q), you will NOT be bored. For courses the 1st half was mostly review but with more rigour and building intuition (especially w/ domain, ranges, & limits). The 2nd half was mostly new stuff (I'm saying this from a regular public ontario highschool pov, I know other places like BC cover much more calc). Other than that was a fine course, but Dan made it 10x better with his energy and calculus jokes
ham,"Wow. Wow. Wow. This course is difficult. The course coordinator Dan has designed it so there is a ""chapter quiz"" every week at the tutorial session. They have 9 questions and are not easy at all. The midterm is worth 30% and the final 50%. The course is mostly a review from high school with integrals being taught at the end. However, the content is all mixed together, like trig is in logs and so on. The quizzes/midterm questions are difficult for no reason, they do not ask simple questions. The textbook is online (you will probably never look at it) and you are not allowed a calculator (this can take some getting used to), so it's the cheapest class you'll ever take. To select your teacher, Dan gave me a headache because he yells and writes on the board for 50 minutes asking questions that cannot be answered because you are taking notes. Dr. McGrath was very nice and shared notes before the class so you could listen. Brain Ingalls filled in for a class and he seemed really nice and understood that the students were not math majors and just needed to take the course. Overall, the coordinator did a pretty bad job, we started with 950 science/CS students and ended with 650. This shows how difficult and draining it was. Take it online if you can and good luck."
ham,"This course was very well organized. Although the first few quizzes were difficult, it was easy to score high marks once you learned what the TAs were looking for when they mark. Dr. McGrath was a great prof, his lectures were very clear and easy to follow because he shares his lecture slides. He also goes through practice problems that are similar to what you would see on the quizzes. Definitely recommend going to his office hours (even if you're not in his section) because he goes through problems step-by-step and really takes the time to clarify any doubts that you might have. "
ham,First few quizzes, everyone got rolled (50s averages). TAs started to mark super nicely after everyone started failing the quizzes. Some of it is high school review. Make sure to do the practice questions provided (especially the ones shown in lectures + lecture supplements). 10 x 2% quizzes + 30% midterm (can redo midterm then take average of those two if you do better on midterm rewrite) + 50% final. f22 coordinator said that midterm can be dropped if final exam was done better than midterm.
ham,First half of the course is similar to Ontario high school math (advanced functions & calculus). after that it goes into new topics with mild difficulty. I will say the topics are much easier than the assessments. Weekly quizzes have hard questions.
ham,The course was a college version of high school math. The professor was not clear in his articulation of knowledge so most of the things like formulas or difficult questions went misunderstood. The TAs for this course were not helpful at all in my experience. They did not reply to emails on time or cleared doubts properly. To this ace this course and exam its really important to once again revise high school calculus and do questions before you enter the class so that you are not confused. If you are a psychology major, this course was not helpful in any upper years but might be for other science courses.
ham,Good introduction to a lot of stats concepts, however most of the information is not used again in 2B or up. Pretty easy course if you attend the lectures. The concepts aren't hard but will look confusing if you're seeing them on an exam for the first time.
ham,I understand that the school has to include stats for accreditation purposes, but this course felt out of left field. Tutorial assignments were open book and basically participation marks. However, they had a seating arrangement for whatever reason and the papers were never laid out properly. There was always a scramble to get the assigned paper and it was such a mess. Midterm was difficult but fair. Final was brutal. The content itself is not difficult but our prof made sure that the class avg would go down.
ham,Should have been easier but I did really well in the midterm and essentially stopped studying so my final grade was significantly lower than it should have been. It's not a super hard course, but you shouldn't ignore it.
ham,Quite useful, but I sucked at it. Even worse considering that the lectures had terrible audio, slides were disorganized, and writing was unreadable. For the final, we were given a completely useless hand-written formula sheet. Unacceptable
ham,"First half is hard if you didn't take stats in high school or if you don't have the natural intuition for it but the content is interesting/cool. Second half is also hard because you get flooded with content but actually understanding the content isn't so bad. Problems become a lot more methodical too (as opposed to freestyling problems in the first half) so overall the second half is easier.
Some stuff is useful, the most useful takeaway is actually understanding statistics and probability and debunking the common misconceptions."
ham,"I took ME 202 back in Winter 2019 before the pandemic.
The first half of the course covers set theory, simple statistical formulae, and probability, all of which I covered back in IGCSE mathematics in high school. However, the content post midterm becomes brutally more challenging and difficult."
ham,If you took a statistics course in high school you'll definitely have an advantage. Content in lectures wasn't always explained thoroughly and the concept quizzes were challenging. However, the textbook was a good resource for both understanding and practice problems, and assessments (course project & exams) were somewhat fair in terms of grading.
ham,Course was all probability in the first half, all equations/formulas in the second half. First half you kinda have to have a natural intuition which was tough for me. Much much more equation based post midterm which was good. Midterm was alright, final was a disaster. Incredibly vague questions which led some people to use the wrong test for an entire question. Lecture notes are well organized and easy to follow.
ham,Course with some pretty useful applications to help engineering students describe data. Pretty straightforward with equations on how to use them. Figure out how to do a confidence interval and hypothesis test and you're blessed.
ham,felt like an absolute waste of time and was excruciatingly difficult to study for especially pre midterm content. pre midterm was terrible counting stuff that made no sense to me. first quiz was super rough as well. midterm however was fair and the 2 quizzes post midterm were pretty easy. final was fair as well as we were basically told what 4/7 of the questions were going to be. after finishing the course i can confidently say it was a complete waste of time.
ham,Another potentially useful course ruined by Charles Kwan. I'm writing this in 4B and I've had Charles Kwan 3 times prior to this. Completely disorganized unclear lecture slides and notes. Unreasonably difficult assignments and exams. A common theme with this prof. Take this course ONLY if Charles Kwan isn't teaching it.
ham,Got to learn about polymers and composites, something that isn't thought about too much in ME. Found that even though I didn't have a good idea on these topics from first/second year, the course was not too intimidating. I watched all the lectures (covid) and went back on the slides I annotated and made detailed notes. The evaluations have gone well so far. I am interested in this topic and am quite enjoying my time.
ham,"It was a fantastic course. We learned about music from a variety of different cultures, but didn't get to EVERYTHING because of poor planning, I think.
The Balinese workshops were fantastic! You got to feel the music and be inside it, rather than just distanced listening (I actually like this music when I play it, but not when I listen to it)
We did run out of time at the end of the course and had to skip a few units which was disappointing which was the poor planning.

I was sick a lot this semester and missed quite a few lectures, and I would have preferred a firm textbook to readings on learn, they were too scattered and random to fully grasp and have a great resource point. Lectures are important, attending them will help a lot.

The huge research paper came out of nowhere at me because it was my first semester first year and I procrastinated. Come on, who doesn't even a little? BUT! I got to know the Grebel library and Librarians who are all super friendly and super helpful!"
ham,"The course had biweekly submissions, each one focusing on a specific deliverable (lit review, constraints, design, verification plan, simulations), then a final report which combined all the submissions.
It was useful for fleshing out the FYDP and making steady progress, but grading was questionable.
The marking on the final report was brutal - some groups went from 100 to 60. This course counts as a full credit for degree average and is non-optional. If you need grades for grad school, good luck and pray for mercy."
ham,I was hoping this course would give me useful knowledge on project management. Instead, it's incredibly bird. ~1 hour of work each week, glossing over anything that's potentially useful. All the assignments revolve around a single case study.
ham,One of the few PD courses that feels relevant in the real world (from an engineering perspective) and has a bit of technical content. Lectures are a combination of videos + interviews. There's a bunch of additional content, including stuff to prepare you for the CAPM exam. Each assignment is slightly different, but most of them revolve around one case study. The course has an IT bias.
ham,It's a PD course that is somewhat useful but, really, if you're someone who already plans ahead for important things in life and can execute those plans (which most of us, at this point in life, should be able to do) then there's nothing new to be learned here. Focus on passing and spend the time you save on other courses.
ham,"Another PD course. Reasonably birdy, but still a chore to complete every 2 weeks. Lots of forced ""reflection"" questions where you make up a past coop story to describe how course content applies. Requires just enough effort that you actually have to search the course notes, but too little effort to retain any knowledge."
ham,An easy course by physics standards, the assignments were fun and produced interesting results, especially considering how simple the math was. The textbook (The Cosmic Perspective by Bennett et al.) was not used at all in Epp's class.
ham,The professor went over a lot of other things we were learning in physics and he offered a different way of looking at concepts. The work load was annoying the online quizzes were easy but the problem sets were difficult and time consuming. Astronomy isn't for me.
ham,"This course was fantastic! It was so interesting and it covers so many topics only using 1st year physics concepts. I took this in 4B as a bird course, so I didn't find it very hard but it could be hard for 1st years. There is a lot of work assigned in it though. The exams are very fair, they're almost identical to assignment questions."
ham,"Ah, one of the most fun classes you'll be in. The course load is overall pretty light, although the bi-weekly problem sets can take a while. Overall, I am fascinated  by how interesting our universe is, if you like Space and Cosmology, I'd definitely recommend this course."
ham,DO NOT TAKE THIS CLASS!!! The other people's reviews made me take it, and i regret it so much. THIS IS NOT AN EASY CLASS. The problem sets are VERY hard and the lectures will make you leave not knowing anything. AVOID!!!
ham,"This course is a very interesting course that uses high-school physics (like Newton's law of gravity and basic relativity/quantum mechanics) to teach you really interesting stuff about the universe! You will approximate many things, and simplify expressions to give you the bigger picture about important physical concepts. The textbook was barely used for this class, only for the simple weekly assignments. The problem sets will make you think and require some good algebra skills, but the questions will generally guide you towards results you need to prove, or ask you to plug in numbers that will probably amaze you."
ham,The course is very interesting conceptually, and is simple on mathematics, but it involves a massive amount of boring computations. The midterm and the final were also heavy on computations (about 60% of the time I was doing and checking my arithmetic), which was rather irritating. Bi-weekly assignments were OK, since you have more time for computations, but they were pretty long and heavy on computations as well.
ham,Covers a lot of interesting topics, both quickly and with a reasonable amount of depth. The exam was fair except for the final unit, dark matter and dark energy, which we didn't get an assignment on before the final.
ham,Really enjoyed this course. The material is very interesting, and although the problem sets are challenging, they were very fun to do. Don't take this course if you think its a bird, because it is definitely time-consuming & can be challenging at points (especially the midterm).
ham,The most interesting and exciting course I've ever take. Mastering Physics assignments are light. But problem sets may be challenging for those who take it as bird course. Just watch the recorded lectures when doing them and you can get 80+
ham,"The course was a lot of fun and quite interesting at times. I do believe the first part (dealing with the history of astronomy) was a bit uninteresting, but the course gets much better after that, and I enjoyed the fact that we dove into the math regularly.

That being said, some of the TAs grading the problem sets are... excessive. I'm sure they have good intentions - and the majority of them are nice - but the comments they made on my problem sets were passively aggressive and, frankly, really pissed me off. Comments are supposed to make me learn, not make me feel like a piece of shit for missing something. In addition, I don't think there was a universal grading scheme for each problem set, because the amount of points you'd get off from a mistake varies between each TA.

Asides from that the course was relatively easy, but I dislike the fact we don't get final results back. "
ham,"This was probably my favourite course in first year as a physastro major. The  history part was interesting to learn about, but it was mostly tedious geometry to work with. However, the later parts of the course were super interesting and really get you excited about astronomy. You should be fairly good at manipulating equations and making approximations. The problem sets were genuinely very interesting and made you think and felt really satisfying to solve. The mastering is kinda a waste of time but a free 20%. The midterm and final were a bit tough, make sure to attend lectures because they test you on specific little things Epp talks about in class. Overall, its a really fun course that I enjoyed and I hope future courses are kinda like this."
ham,Easy and interesting course. Weekly assignments on Mastering Astronomy (MC and some short calculations) are basically free marks, but dont leave it til last minute. Biweekly problem sets (5 of em) could be challenging, theres more math than phys. Midterm and finals are mostly based on biweekly ps so make sure u understand how the related equations are derived-- they WONT be provided. 80+ should be manageable.
ham,"This course was interesting, it ties the material from E&M 1&2 together and applies it to areas like radiation and optics. There's a good chance you won't do any relativity in this course, even though it's in the description."
ham,This was a very manageable workload and is an interesting course if you are considering going into an education career. While I did find the lecture/readings to be pretty dry and extensive, the assessments are all very fair. From what I remember, the course consisted of weekly/biweekly quizzes, 2 larger written assignments, and a end-of-term reflection assignment. A huge godsend was the 4% SONA bonus + 2% bonus marks that they just decided to give to everyone... 6% !!!
ham,Pretty pointless course to be completely honest. It's all very obvious stuff and I can't say any of it was really interesting. It's pretty easy as well, but the structure of the course may just be annoying (we had textbook quizzes, group assignment, case study, inclass final, in class reaction papers - it was all just 'trying to hard to make something so simple so tedious').
ham,"It was definitely an easy course, every time in class I just roamed around facebook and stuff. I did well in every individual assignment. There is a group assignment about ""having fun"" worth 20% of your final mark. Make sure your group members do their work, that assignment was brutally marked. Overall, boring but easy course."
ham,After taking this class, I do not consider it a bird. There is NO multiple choice in this class- 75% of your mark is writing- 2 assignments, 5 online discussions, 1 midterm (answer a question using peer reviewed journal articles and cite with APA) and an in class exam. The TA's mark seriously, you have to put in a lot of effort to get a good grade. You get docked heavily for improper use of APA formatting.
ham,"I took it as an online course. The quizzes were fairly difficult and are worth a bit marks which covered mostly on the textbook and TEDtalks that were posted. You must remember some of the Tedtalk concepts and be able to recall material from the textbook. The assignments were fair and helped boost your overall mark significantly as the quizzes tend to be harder for those who do not have the textbook. There will be 20 question final exam review in which 10 will be word for word on the exam which makes it very nice to help prepare your answers ahead of time. The exam will cover mostly on concepts from the online modules that include definitions and examples that come with the definitions.

Overall I think this course was pretty fun and easy"
ham,Took this as an online course during the Winter term. Approximately 20 pages of reading per week, plus weekly modules to read through. Two assignments worth 20%, and 4 quizzes (multiple choice) worth 5% each (to make up 60% of your grade) and the exam is 40%. Exam is 5 long answer questions - but 10 possible questions that may appear on the exam are posted a week prior (so its easy to get high 90s on the exam, I got 100% with two days preparation). Overall, content is interesting and this is a bird course... as long as you don't mind doing readings (you don't need to make notes on them, just reading them is enough).
ham,Content was not that interesting. You had to write a fair bit as well, and that involves primary source research and citations. Overall I would have expected a bird course like this to be more chill. The readings were annoying to do as well. There were online quizzes for the content modules, and sometimes it wasn't clear where the answers were coming from. I ended up CTRL+F most of the questions in the modules and reading material just to figure out the answer.
ham,Quizzes are fked as they don't even relate to the correct chapters because some genius messed up the order. Chapter 12 questions end up in Quiz 2 when they're supposed to be in Quiz 3 and that just means trying to CTRL+F everything in time. Assignments are hit and miss too, as you literally have to include a reference to the text every 3 sentences or the TAs don't like it. Might not be a difficult course but a high 80s is not really possible.
ham,Prof was nice and engaged with students sometimes. Content was useful for future rec courses, but it's just common sense. Really tried hard in this class and was disappointed to receive low final grade despite decent grades throughout semester.
ham,This course in the Fall 2021 term was NOT a bird course at all. The quizzes are quite easy if you study the modules, but the TA's really did me wrong on the assignments and I received below 70's on all major assignments, so 80's/90's on the 4 quizzes accumulating to 25%, didn't really help my grade. I don't know how the course is in person due to Covid, but overall this course destroyed my GPA.
ham,"I took this course because I thought it would be a bird course and this course was not a bird course, the quizzes were not easy i was not able to find the answers within the provided documents online and the readings were quite long and there were many readings. This is NOT a bird course. I also took thiis course f20 online"
ham,"THIS IS NOT A BIRD COURSE. DO NOT TAKE IT TO BOOST YOUR GPA
Course content can be interesting but also long at times.

Online quizzes were super easy

The assignments were atrocious, I think it depends on the TA but this is not marked like a first-year course. Could barely get over a 70 on the case study and leisure activity papers. Can't even go over the grade you received with your TA because otherwise you could lose 5% for ""professionalism"" 

Look elsewhere for an easy course"
ham,course included four quizzes, a case study, a final paper and a final test. Prof well prepared us for the final test. Quizzes aren't bad if you have done all the readings. only downside is that included reading sometimes 20+ pages out of a textbook.
ham,Made up of a 20% participation report, follow the instructions for an easy 90. 4 content quizzes that make up 20%, primarily easy questions with some random textbook questions sprinkled in. With a 30% Case study, TAs are really concerned with perfect APA formatting for both in-text and references and can get a decent 70 with minimal effort. Finally, a 25% online exam where the questions are given beforehand, write down the main points for each question beforehand and you should be fine. Plus 5% for professionalism just don't criticize grades given and you'll be fine. Btw this is for Kylie Wasser's class.
ham,bird course if the ta marking is super nice. decent amount of writing if thats ur thing. 4 x 5% content quizzes, all answers are in readings/textbook (ctrl f) but 20 questions in 25 minutes + 20% participation report (choose a leisure activity and answer questions) + 30% case report (choose a case study, answer questions) + 25% in class final (wrote this online, prof gave questions ahead of time and for actual test, 3 out of 10 are put on the test) + 5% professionalism (just be a normal student and polite). make sure to focus on apa citation a lot bc tas are super picky about that
ham,The online class is easy but it takes up a lot of time. Three discussion posts (have to read 1-3 fairy tales per post) and 3 responses to other threads and then a 500-word unit review per week. Then there are two essays 1200-1600 word essays which are spaced out pretty well. The content in this class is easy but it is just a lot of work.
ham,"Get ready for an extremely independent course with little to no input from the Prof or the TA. You are completely on your own, no review, no nothing. Just listen to 12 Modules each consisting of 13-115 mins of lecture.  No lecture notes, and you can't download the videos. A total of 3 online 80 question multiple choice tests, and a 500 word final course reflection, then a 30% final exam, written in person. Very bird, but very dry and dull content at times. Pure memorization, no application, 100s of terms and dates."
ham,Had Peter Frick - terrible professor. Lecture slides contain no relevant information making them impossible to study off of.  Had unannounced pop-up quizzes on minor details, worth around 5% each. Exams were fill in the blanks and long answer. Long answer portion was extremely subjective and impossible to achieve over a 75%. Lectures are very dry, however he will expect you to memorize nearly everything he says.
ham,I took this online and the content was heavy, not a good elective course if you're looking for a bird course -- It was interesting in how they compared and presented the different religions none the less
ham,This was probably my favourite course I've taken at Waterloo so far (3rd year Software). I've always been interested in astronomy, so the material was very interesting to me. Assignments were easy relative to engineering courses such as PHYS 115, and exams are mostly just memorization. Using memory tricks like weaving details into a story and the method of loci, got 49/50 on the midterm by just spending, on average, 1 minute per slide the night before.
ham,Took the online course, ended up doing much better than expected (the final got bell curved). Touches on some interesting concepts and serves as a good introduction course. Though I haven't listened to any of the lectures (I read all the slides as needed for the assignments and re-read them all a day or two before the final exam).
ham,It seems a lot of people were taking this to fulfill their Natural Science Elective in SE. I didn't find it all too interesting, however, but it was pretty easy stuff, as long as your memorization skills are good.
ham,If you take it online, it's going to be a breeze. Essentially 5 assignments that don't really require you to listen to any of the lectures (too bad the slides are not Ctrl+F-able). The final was actually pretty straightforward, although covered quite a bit of content (since there was no midterm).  I enjoyed most of the units.
ham,I took this course expecting it to be a bird course to offset my difficult term. Ended up not being the case. It seems as though this course wildly varies in difficulty based on professors. I recommend taking the course online or making sure the exam is open book. Our midterm average was in the high 60's. Ironically, even though this was supposed to be my mark booster course it ended up being one of my worst marks.
ham,"If you are interested in astronomy, it is ""ok"".

However please note this is an extremely difficult course, contrary to the 85% difficulty rating. The class average for the midterm was 67%. And remember that these are Math/Eng people taking this course.

So if you are okay with 60's, go ahead and take this course."
ham,Only took this course because I had to fulfill a requirement. I could see some people being interested in this course, but obviously I didn't care enough. Failed the midterm (my fault, didnt study). But did really well in the final for some odd reason (maybe bell curved?). Take it if you like astronomy or need to fulfill a requirement, avoid otherwise.
ham,The assignments are long and tedious and require extra purchase. They are due weekly, and each one usually take me more than 5-7 hours to just go through them. The assignments are not hard by any means. I kept complaining about the website for building such crappy assignment system. The assignments are not well designed, as there may be a lot of duplicated questions in one assignment. It is too much work considering most people are just taking it as a bird course. Speaking of the content, it is way too broad covering all aspects of physics.
ham,The course was a lot of fun and you learn a lot about the universe. It's not exactly knowledge you can bring up in everyday conversation, but would be really good to know for a beginner who is trying to study astronomy. The course included physics, chemistry, and a tiny bit of biology knowledge but it was very light. I thought the course was a lot of fun to take online, and I would guess it would be in-class as well.
ham,The difficulty of this course depends completely on the prof. In particular, Mike Fich's online course's finals are brutal (closed book and you need to know in-depth details from all units, since there is no midterm). The fact that the assignments don't prepare you for the exam in the online course doesn't help.
ham,This course was significantly better than I expected. Each lecture moves quickly and presents a ton of interesting material. This would be an issue, but you only have to remember the general ideas to do well on the exams and assignments. Despite knowing what I thought was a fair amount beforehand, I learned a lot, this course goes far beyond grade school basics. It's like sitting back and watching a cool science documentary every lecture.
ham,Very interesting course. Approaches the content in such a way that you get a very high level understanding of many different topics, without going super in-depth about them. Course was weekly quizzes (very easy) along with multiple choice midterm + final.
ham,An excellent science elective. Even if you have some knowledge of the subject coming in, you're still bound to learn some interesting content you didn't know before. The content is mostly conceptual but with occasional simple math problems. Low workload and fairly easy exams.
ham,"If you watched space documentaries as a kid, this course won't teach you that much.

If you're taking it online, be careful not to skip assignments. They're worth 10% each. Also, the final was very memory-heavy whereas the assignments were computational. Watch out!"
ham,Lectures were extremely slow and felt drawn out to fill up the time slot, and we just kept going for the clicker marks. The course was otherwise a pretty good time with Hudson, problem sets, midterms and exams were a mixture of computational and conceptual stuff while the online quizzes were multiple choice only. Some of the computational problems were pretty creative and interesting. Good breadth of topics but not much depth, pretty well set up for an intro course.
ham,I'm not enjoying this course at all. The quizzes are hard but assignments are easy to get marks if you study. Lots of concepts to memeorize. If you are not interested in it, you are gonna have a hard time on it
ham,Not an easy course by any means. With that said if you're into astronomy and cool physics that you might not normally learn within your core courses, this really is a great introduction. The assignments weren't too hard but the final exam was pretty tough. I took this course back in F19 and I remember studying for the final I made a 70-page word doc with figures and stuff just to capture all the content. I would definitely recommend getting your hands on as many old finals as possible to study from cus sometimes questions are recycled.
ham,Did not like the way the course notes and videos were delivered, also did not like having to use Discord for communication. The course felt really unprofessional. Was confusing to find the materials you are looking for, since nothing was available on Learn.
ham,Weekly online assignments (each took about 40min-1hr to complete). 2 midterms and 1 final which were basically random memorization facts + a few long answer questions. You are allowed to bring cheatsheets, but they're sort of useless because the questions were essentially trivia. Still easy enough to get an 80+ final mark.
ham,Interesting course, with not too much content and very engaging lectures. The grade comes from 50% assignments and 50% timed quizzes. This course involves a lot more math than I have anticipated (all assignments are thinking calculation questions). So I would recommend this course only to people who are solid in calculus and excel.
ham,This class has online assignments, 2 open book midterms, and an open book exam. You can bring in your notes, even printed, and also the textbook. All of the assessments were fair. The content was interesting. All around decent class. Try to do well on those early assignments as they get a bit harder near the end.
ham,I took it online.  I didn't have to dedicate that much for it.  WARNING- options are 100% exam or 30% paper/70% exam....Do the paper or else you will have to write a whole other section on the final.  The final was easy I am just glad I didn't have to write another essay during the exam time like my peers who opted for the 100% exam did.
ham,"very interesting and not as intense as it might seem at first! exam was a piece of cake, don't be frightened by the 100% worth!! that being said, there was a mixup with the exam this year and i accidentally got the ""Option 1"" exam (ie for people who elected to write an essay and have the exam not be worth 100%) and a few questions were different, easier imo."
ham,Course grade determined by three term tests and final exam. Term tests make you think you did well, but then you get your grade back and feel confused as to what you did wrong. Final exam is only written word questions with most of study guide on exam. Just memorize your definitions, and the exam will be easy.
ham,Took it in-person. There were two midterms (25% each), optional essay assignment (20%) and take-home final (30%). Go to lectures, take notes, then midterm and final will be easy with little memorization. DO NOT BUY THE BOOKS! Save money and go to the lectures instead.
ham,Really interesting topics. You have to take notes though because the slides are not made available online, but you can take pictures after class. Not difficult if you understand or memorize you're notes you'll be good. Really straightfoward.
ham,W18 Annik combined oral, comprehension and written formats for each test which I found was more difficult. Be on top of the final project (start early and get as much feedback as possible). Also, almost every lesson was about love and relationships which was annoying but ppl had spicy stories so it was fun in the end.
ham,If you enjoyed the 200 level of Spanish, 301 is just and extension of that. It engages you and combines everything you learned through the 100 and 200 levels. By the end of class, you will be able to have a good conversation in Spanish.
ham,The course description is incorrect. R program is used now . Not SAS. The lack of support for R makes the course challenging but luckily there is much internet resource to help you out. Its just challenging to do such with full-time work or full-time school work.
ham,This class was good. The textbook is a bit difficult to read but you only really need it for an essay. I would suggest borrowing it from the library instead of buying it, you can take it out for two weeks as its not a course reserve. The class consist of two essays and a big group presentation. Good luck!!!
ham,Fun course, but pretty easy/slow if you know programming or you've had software jobs. However, if you don't like programming or just find it plain difficult, you will often be frustrated by the labs and the exams.
ham,Had Prof. Shi Cao. One of the most, if not the most, organized courses this term. Love his enthusiasm and he explains concepts very well. If you come in with 0 CS knowledge, you may struggle, but if you have even a slight bit of relevant coding experience, it should not be too hard. Exams and assignments are also fair. Seen a few complaints about the auto-grading, which could be better.
ham,"The course is pretty useful for software coops, and the content is interesting enough.

Taught by Shi Cao, the most wholesome prof I've ever had. Man's such a good dad and tries his best to explain!! Also his slides have a few anime/movie references that make me smile :). "

ham,easy course but too many assignments
spam,pretty cool course
ham,"Bird with Niayesh, everything open book"
ham,Easy, if you love astronomy and physics
ham,A+ course, would recommend to all students.
ham,this was in my schedule?
ham,keep up with the readings
ham,Class discussions sometimes differ from textbook - participation is a substantial portion of your grade, compared to some other courses
ham,Lots of group work, though learned a lot about Access and internal controls
ham,The second half of this course was just a slew of highly similar frameworks that we had to memorize the minutiae of. Not useful and pretty time-consuming.
ham,Fairly easy course. Quizzes and participation are free marks and the exams aren't bad if you listen in class and prep well. Project is quite lengthy and very time consuming.
ham,Extremely interesting course, amount of memorization is quite difficult if you leave it to the last minute. Can get a good mark if you put in the effort.
ham,for this semester all we talked about was covid and I wanted to pull my hair out.
ham,Course was easy until finals. Course was useless - spent most of our time copying down derivations...
ham,Really enjoyed this course! Matlab is a lot of fun
ham,Simple, straightforward lab that pulls a lot from the course material. Worth taking to develop basic lab skills.
ham,Sue is the best, never like the lab exam, for this OR for the 120 lab.
ham,Can be really fun if you know your TA well.  Very relaxing if you like to do labs.
ham,"I liked the experiments we did in this lab. Make sure you read everything well before coming to class and complete all quizzes on time, it was a really fair lab."
ham,A good lab course. Experiments are interesting and the lab reports are fairly easy (you get two weeks to complete them). The final MC exam is also pretty easy.
ham,I'm a huge fan of the hands on stuff we do in the chem labs and this one was no exception.
ham,Similar to 120L but has some random labs that use material you haven't covered yet. I advise starting the labs early (not last minute) for this reason, so you can go get help with the Orgo
ham,Be careful with what your lab reports are asking you, and study those questions carefully for the final.
ham,The labs are easier that 122L, your mark is really just dependent on your TA. Concepts are simple though, nothing to challenging required
ham,The lab reports can be extremely time consuming! The final exam was quite challenging, but less challenging than the 120 lab exam.
ham,So boring, waste of my time writing dumb lab reports. Easy 90+ with a good TA. My TA was way better than 120l TA. 120L TA you should be like my 123L TA/
ham,The labs this time around are much more difficult as compared to Chem 120L, however it is run exactly the same, and so with Chem 120L under your belt, good marks are attainable.
ham,Make sure you do all of the labs early, as they take much longer than you'd expect (especially the reactions rate lab)
ham,Had to take this as a physics major, but I feel like this will be totally useless later on
ham,Good lab but the final is hard. Lots of questions with not enough time. The lab reports are also very time consuming
ham,Disjointed w the lec. Terrible TA  who didn't talk to us and mislead us pretty often.-_-
ham,Interesting experiments, but the report marking depends largely on your TA. and that final exam was a bit absurd.
ham,Sue & labs were great, lots of content but fun/useful. Exam is surprisingly hard though, do your practice questions/review
ham,If you've taken Metab 1 and Metab 2, this course is definitely the one to take if you are finishing up biochemistry. It will merge everything you've learned and complete the picture.
ham,Concepts were interesting but a little repetitive. Relevance to program is high. Definitely recommend to take as a civil engineering student.
ham,Interesting bird course. Good course to take if you want some variety in your course selection.
ham,I would recommend this course for anyone looking for an easy elective. The material is pretty interesting. There are 3 m/c exams and no final which are easy if you cram for just 2 hours.
ham,Easy bird course as long as you study before tests
ham,You need the book so this course can become easy. 1/3 of the questions are from the book so it is a must. Class avg is 77% for the 2nd midterm
ham,Interesting enough course. For anyone looking for an elective or humanities course you could do far worse than this one.
ham,50/50 depending on prof. If you get stuck with a bad prof (eg. buss or toman), you are going to absolutely hate this course.
ham,Tough course. Lots of people failed, didn't see any use for it in future terms.
ham,Good, go to class, do assignments, open book midterms
ham,Don't expect too much utility out of this class.  The proof systems are sort of neat, it's challenging enough.  Unfortunately we all need to take it, hope they change the format soon.
ham,I don't really see how I will use this course, you can't do a formal proof for every program you write. And if you did you wouldn't limit yourself to not using certain rules just because.
ham,Quite difficult, despite the open book examinations. Course is subjective based on your professor.
ham,A necessary evil that I hope will become more interesting in the future.
ham,Very messed up course. Open book midterm does not make it easy.
ham,This course has terrible structure and planning. I feel like the extremely subpar instructors and coordinators along with the terrible selected material ruined  this otherwise interesting course...
spam,"They should learn from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq

And princeton: http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/sf/current/deps.html"
ham,The content was too abstract and the assignments were uninteresting. Program verification was OK, though.
ham,even if the idea of this course is brilliant, I admit, but this is the only course I don't want to see on my checklist so far.
ham,Very interesting but it's only really useful for mathematical maturity purposes.
ham,The enriched version of CS245 is definitely worth taking, and it's more of a PMATH course rather than a CS course
ham,Some prof is hard, some is easy. Course hardness really depends on prof.
ham,There were only two profs in this term, and neither of them taught this course well, and made this boring course even more boring.
ham,Found it very interesting and easy to understand, though I know many people who would disagree.
ham,This is definitely a great and useful course to take. Try to think more, not only focus on solving the questions.
ham,Practice a lot. Hope your teacher doesn't screw you.
ham,Worst course I've ever taken. MATH 135 on steroids, but nowhere near as useful.
ham,There could have just been a logic unit in some other CS course
ham,Makes no sense. No idea what I was doing on assignments or on exams.
ham,Really interesting course that changes the way you think!
ham,Was not a fan of this course at all. Thought it was extremely boring and pointless. Do the assignments and you'll be good to go. Sad times.
ham,not useful, midterm is really easy, but after midterm is pretty boring.
ham,Fantastic with Alice Gao, content was interesting and everything made sense, not alot of work.
ham,Fun course if you like doing proofs. Can be bad if you don't. Practice a lot and make sure you go to lectures.
ham,Propositional and predicate logic will definitely come in handy in later courses, but there's not a whole lot of interesting material. Doesn't help that our term skipped Program Verification entirely.
ham,"pretty much an extension on 135
lecture videos were very lengthy (~40 per video, ~5 videos per week) with the prof mostly just reading word by word off the slides"
ham,Took it online during a COVID term, weekly assignments and take-home exams. Assignment difficulty comparable to 135, can be done just by reading off tutorials and slides.
ham,This course is so useless, making us take this should be considered a crime
ham,The course itself is not that bad. Some parts of it are even useful and fun. However, the professors of this course and its structure is a dreadful recurring nightmare.
ham,Homework marks were often taken off for pedantic reasons. The problems themselves were often very tedious.
ham,No help or explanations, online COVID course in fall2021
ham,Lot of proofs to write. Not sure why it's useful for cs students tbh. looks like most of the content would be good for math students instead
ham,please remove it from required courses for cs in the future
ham,"""Instructions for the IAs Please remind the students: The course will become more challenging, soon. Be prepared to put in more time, if needed"". I guess I somehow only have 1 course this term."
ham,i mean if your cs you'd have to take it, so there's no point complaining :)
ham,Not very interesting, not particularly easy, and not at all useful. This course could use a rewrite.
ham,Honestly, the course itself is quite interesting. It's just the overall structure of the assessments and the grading schemes being kinda unreasonable.
ham,Pretty easy up until decidability. The content is not worth going to lectures for, just read the slides.
ham,Only useful content in this course is Hoare Logic. Everything was fair on the midterm + exam, but it's boring and annoying to do.
ham,Content was not too difficult as long as you practiced and did tutorial problems. It could be interesting depending on if you enjoy logic puzzles and computing theory (Turing machines, etc.)
ham,Given a student S, prove that it is undecidable that the student passes or fails CS245. (Hint: reduce the halting problem)
ham,Not that hard, but extremely boring. The profs also take a long time to answer on Piazza and honestly it feels like this course is useless/out of place.
ham,hate this course, wouldn't recommend taking it unless it's a required course for your major. don't think its content will ever be useful in the future :/
ham,I don't have anything good to say for this course. Concepts were difficult to understand and there wasn't enough material to practice problems on.
ham,Found the content interesting but I felt like it didn't really improve my skills for logic
ham,Brought back high school memories. Lila was a great prof! You'll love it if you like AMATH stuff I think. I absolutely loved it.
ham,Content taught is pretty interesting, also pretty free course, easy 90+.
ham,Great assignments - boring material. Confusing lectures.
ham,Not much stuff on lecture notes. Programming assignments are interesting and probably useful. It seems that its content is overlapping with a number of other courses.
ham,Nothing learned was relevant to current technology. Do not take. Just look at stuff on your own time.
ham,It was a good course overall. Lots of stuff to learn. Dry like burnt toast though . Moderate amount of work but it was concentrated into short bursts that got pretty stressful
ham,Content is alright, but a lot of it is pretty obvious/intuitive. Not the worst CS course I've taken but not the best. Assignments weren't very relevant.
ham,Taught by a good prof so it made it interesting. Not very applicable until the last lecture where he spoke about applications and career aspects of paleobiology.
ham,May be one of the toughest classes I've ever taken... 2nd midterm was the worst thing ever! Questions on stuff we'd never looked at before! Assignments were usually really tough!
ham,Feel like I learned everything this course intends to offer, haven't got this feeling for a long time.
ham,Don't be scared of the graphing/trend line assignments - they are marked easily, but the methods are very important.
ham,No exam, pick a good topic from the get go, you'll be using it all term
ham,Quite a useful course. It gives you an idea of what to do and what not to do in scientific writing. Not really my kind of course to be honest, but I didn't dislike it.
ham,The course is easy, interesting, and useful. It teaches you pronunciation notation and sentence structures. Homework every other week is from the textbook and straightforward.
ham,ALWAYS DO YOUR HOMEWORK (and keep up with required readings).
ham,Interesting course if you want to learn (an introduction to) how language works
ham,Phonetics and phonology were boring. Morphology and syntax are awesome though. Not a total bird course, but if you practice the problems you'll do just fine. Take it only if you're really interested.
ham,Pretty easy, gives a good overview of linguistics. Learned some new perspectives
ham,A very fun and engaging course covering many aspects about English and language in general. Definitely enjoyed taking it.
ham,Tests are incredibly easy, and content is incredibly simple. Came in wanting to learn linguistics, ended up learning jack sh*t. Literally what I would expect from a grade 10 applied course.
ham,Took this as a 4th year CSE. Fun course, got to learn about language and how it's defined, studied, and used around the world.
ham,If you have Forrester, it's basically a high school course.
ham,A really really interesting course that takes a decent amount of work to get good grades in.
ham,good course to take for electives. learned quite a lot as well.
ham,My favourite course so far. Labs were a lot of fun to do and I felt like I actually learned a lot. Although it was difficult, if you're willing to work for it, you can come out with a great mark still
ham,The course content isn't too difficult and is fairly interesting. The lab component is definitely more enjoyable in better weather, so if you can pick which term you take this course avoid winter.
ham,Field trips were fun. I personally enjoyed this course.
ham,Fairly graded exam material, no assignments, showing up to labs are easy grades as well.
ham,Really liked the course. As long as you keep up with the readings, you should be fine with an 80. Memorization is key and study in advanced. The final was kind of detailed.
ham,the lectures are key. don't make the lab report scientific, make it fit the example format and think like an ecologist. take pictures of the slides. B. Larson oft is a hard marker if you get him
ham,Super interesting content, but decent workload with multiple weekly assignments. This course got me interested in Ecology and Biology.
ham,its alright. I like environmental stuff but honestly I found the labs a bit tedious. not hard tho.
ham,Hated this course, thankfully still did well. Labs are as complicated as it ever gets otherwise it is fine
ham,A lot of material to memorise from the textbook, weekly lectures, and labs. Overall a fun course, and I enjoyed the labs (be warned that no weather conditions will stop the lab from happening).
ham,The labs are really interesting. Work can be kind of tedious especially if ecology isn't your thing. Lectures are long and necessary if you want to do well in exams.
ham,Labs were interesting lectures were engaging but the midterm and exam were really tough compared to the rest of the course content
ham,The lectures were content-heavy  and the readings were fairly extensive. Labs were fairly straightforward.
ham,Very similar to GBDA 101 - if you have experience with videography or the Adobe Suite then you'll be at a very clear advantage.
ham,You get shown how geography and human health are related to each other. There are weekly discussion posts which aren't too much work. It's a little boring sometimes
ham,I don't think this course is super helpful but definitely a bird one. The content is easy to comprehend your grade is mainly discussion based and major projects literally lightwork.
ham,Very interesting content. Related a lot to current events around the world.
ham,Very interesting modules.Has a final exam and research essay.
ham,Good course to take if you like to learn about art history and civilization. Take it with Vanessa Rukholm she's really nice and her lectures are interesting
ham,Helpful if you're going to become a lawyer or have a lot of conflict in your life. Pretty good bird course
ham,Pretty good course. You learn a lot and it's actually information you may need down the line but be warned that there are a lot of long readings.
ham,This course is mostly review from Grade 12 Calculus. Because of that it was not too hard.  Exams were kindof hard compared to the assignments which was weird. But overall it was an okay course.
ham,Try to review the material everyday I got my ass kicked when I tried to cram the weekly assignment. Go over textbook questions if you don't get the ones in the assignments.
ham,I'm not going to lie this course was made a lot more awesome because of the prof.
ham,The course is almost a direct copy of high school calculus and advanced functions. Keep up with yourself and you'll do fine
ham,Assignments had very esoteric questions and the midterms were challenging. Best to work though the assignments with a friend.
ham,"It's hardly even calculus until more than halfway through the course, a lot of high school review. Pretty easy if you can keep on top of the assignments."
ham,This course took things from high school that were simple to understand and made them unnecessarily complicated
ham,up until the midterm was highschool review. The course gets tough in the 2nd part of the semester.
ham,Mostly a review of high school calc. If you've taken AP Calc in high school and learned integrals you should already know everything in this course.
ham,Make sure to do your assignments and read over the notes! Other than that it will be pretty straight forward.
ham,For the first three quarters of the class it reviews all the math from high school. The last quarter is antiderivatives and integrals.
ham,Definitely a challenge towards the end but very interesting
ham,This course sucks. Since it is a requirement for sciences just go to class and pass with a 50 so you never have to take it again.
ham,If math is not your thing avoid this class at all costs. I found the weekly assignments to be super difficult!
ham,Over half the course focused on grade 11 and 12 functions. Assignments were much harder than the term tests. The midterm was harder than the final but both were relatively easy.
ham,Then end of the course it got a little hard but before that it was almost all review. Do the assignments and practice.
ham,The first half of this course is mostly review but after the midterm it gets pretty difficult and it is important to keep up with any practice questions assigned by your prof.
ham,Pretty easy course - mostly the same as gr. 12 calculus.  It's helpful to do the worksheets they give you as the questions on quizzes are really similar.
ham,A good calculus course but it goes incredibly fast. Definitely take the course with Woody he makes it a lot better.
ham,Wasn't the easiest. Keep up with the assignments and do a lot of practice exams before the final exam.
ham,Basic calculus course. If you do the homework and worksheets you should have no problem on the quizzes and exams.
ham,Essentially a review from Grade 12 Calculus. Required minimal effort. Just do the worksheets and if you do not understand refer to the textbook.
ham,easy course as long as you go through the textbook
ham,I am the type of person who will never use calculus again in my life. I did not enjoy the class and struggled to do well. The questions were difficult and the course average was low.
ham,Simple course if you do all the practice problems and final exams from past years. Average is 60ish but hard work makes this course manageable. 90+ is easily achievable if you put in the work.
ham,Keep on top of your stuf mostly just review from grade 12.
ham,If you took grade 12 Calculus you should do extremely good in this course because most of the class is grade 12 calculus.
ham,Stay abreast with the work. Like all Math courses this is the key to success. I strongly recommend Paul McGrath
ham,High school calculus + VERY SIMPLE integration. Very rather easy imo.
ham,Failed this course keep up with whats going on in class because before you know it the final exam will come around and you'll be completly lost.
ham,"Don't fall behind on this class. And don't have Puneet Sharma as an instructor.
ham,Mostly a review of high school calculus except towards the end with integration. EoLs are very effective practice.
ham,Don't fall behind! Starts with review from high school and the end is full of integrals and such.
ham,Most of the course is just high school math. If you are good at math this course moves pretty slowly. However the content is extremely clear and thorough.
ham,Not that bad unless you fall behind (which occurred more quickly than I would have thought).
ham,Basically advanced functions up until the midterm then grade 12 calculus after that. A bit of integration is taught at the end but overall very easy course.
ham,High school math stuff review functions derivativesintegrations...
ham,got a 91 but still the expectations of TA while grading were unreasonable
ham,The tests are nothing like the practices or the learning modules. goodluck.
ham,Grade 12 calculus was harder. Just pay attention and study a decent amount to do well. I think it has been adapted online well and tests your knowledge fairly
ham,Useless lectures but incredibly easy assignments/tests.
ham,Love love love Calc! If you did great in high school you will do great here since the concepts are kinda similar.
ham,Should be a straight shot if you did well in high school calc. Bare effort finished with high 90s.
ham,Super easy course. Did not spend more than 2 hours on this course each week. However the flipped course structure was not handled well the lectures were pretty much useless.
ham,This course is really hard weekly quizzes do help and there is a good grading system but the content goes by extremely quick and you can't miss a class
ham,Focus on learning the methods taught in lecture and look at other profs slide shows after class. Takes a lot of time and effort for someone who does ok with high school calc
ham,Its basically just Grade 12 Calc until last few week of classes. Dan is an amazing prof though
ham,Absolutely hard for no reason concepts are easy but examples are too complicated for no reason
ham,Awesome course very useful. Tip: most of the course is just a build-up to integrals and Reinmann sums. That was probably 80% of the final.
ham,Pretty ez course got a 95. Very chill if you actually go to lecture. The professor was a life savour. Take it with Michelle Molino and your gonna get a pretty much guaranteed 90+.
ham,Repeat of grade 12 calculus and vectors. However teaching style is very different from highschool.
ham,I don't think I remember a single thing from this course. I learned the entire thing the day before the final them proceeded to forget it all right after.
ham,This is a pretty simple and straightforward course overall. If you try you can easily make it one of your best courses of the term.
ham,I had a bad prof so learned most everything on my own. Some stuff are from high school data management class.
ham,Frustrating. Course covers a lot of topics and some application. Assessments are heavily theory based and often tackle things that were not discussed or even mentioned in lectures.1
ham,I found some of the quizzes to be challenging but the grading on the assessments was fair overall
ham,The content is somewhat abstract. Contends with ME230 (if you have Kwan) for toughest course in 2A if you're not that interested in statistics. Do problem sets
ham,This course is a great overview of statistics in general. I applied most of the stuff I learned to my co-op and real-life situation. Very engaging and interesting course as an engineer!
ham,very useful lab actual hands on learning for a lot of techniques used in researches.
ham,very useful if you are looking to enter the field of project management or IT
ham,This course is actually one of the PD courses I recommend since its relevant to many industries. It teaches not only how to be a project manager but how to handle projects in general.
ham,worst PD course ive ever taken its so much work ugh. just take PD 13 (i only did half the work and still passed) or PD 3 much easier
ham,Its easy but a lot of work for a PD course. Not worth it.
ham,This course is awesome. The material was not difficult at all and it was really fun learning about how you can get to some pretty amazing results using very basic physics. Definitely take this course.
ham,Great survey course in Astronomy and Astrophysics. Would definitely recommend as an elective in terms of both difficulty and interesting content!
ham,WARNING! not an easy course at all for those of you who choose this as an bird/easy elective course.
ham,Excellent intro to astronomy. Only thing I might say is that it was a bit too easy / could have focused more on current topics rather than the history of astronomy over the centuries
ham,Not hard and is lots of fun. Dont sleep on the problem sets though they can take 10+ hours
ham,Really interesting content - and problem sets can especially take some time. Pretty heavy course tbh but satisfied my curiosity about astrophysics :).
ham,It's a lot of fun problem sets are really interesting lectures are great MasteringAstronomy is horrible but it's easy marks.
ham,Make sure you go to class! The exams are mostly based on lecture content. And 25% of your final grade are from these reflection papers that you write every other class. Easy 90+
ham,Very simple straightforward introduction to rec & leisure. Not particularly interesting or useful for those not in the program but great as a simple elective.
ham,great introduction to rec and leisure. I got really pumped about my program after this course. but it had everything to do with the prof Diana who doesn't teach it anymore
ham,Useful if you're a Rec'er! Lovely intro course and just stay on top of everything. Everything on the final is from the Lec so attend them!
ham,It is easy to do well in if you do the work really like the way the midterm and final is set up.
ham,It's mandatory to take as a REC student  so it's useful information to have but in terms of interest it's not very fun.
ham,it's one of those prereq courses that is necessary to take in order to take upper year classes
ham,easiest course i've ever taken at UW.. a bit of writing but its all common sense
ham,Literally the basics of the program show up and listen and take good notes
ham,A lot of reading  but assignments and quizzes were fair and easy. My only comment is  the prof is not engaging but TAs are great.
ham,pretty fun course!!! it's easy to manage the workload if you stay organized and the content that gets covered is honestly really interesting to learn about.
ham,Took this course online found it really easy and didn't have to do a ton of nonsense busy work like in some other online classes! Hardly read the textbook and finished with a mark in the 80s.
ham,it was very easy and interesting. the content was pretty specific and was presented in an organized way. It's a bird course but you still have to work a little.
ham,Very good basis for understanding Judaism  Christianity  and Islam  as well as the relations between them.
ham,Attending lectures was key in this class. Quizzes became easier as the course progressed. Content was really interesting and the final research paper is open-ended  which is really nice.
ham,Really great investigation of the first few books of the Bible. We had a few assignments some of which were difficult  but the actual classes were really insightful.
ham,Took it online - slides were very well put together with audio lectures included. Assignments were extremely easy.
ham,Assignments were hard but final exam was relatively easy
ham,"Took it DE. Pretty easy having done Astrophysics before... With DE it's quite possible to go into the final already with a 50%, since there are only assignments and no midterm."
ham,Material is dry and assignments/calculations are tedious. You ain't gonna find Neil Degrasse Tyson quality stuff here
ham,Very interesting elective for those interested in astronomy
ham,If you read the textbook do all the assignments  and try to get whatever bonus marks you can  getting 100% is very possible.
ham,If you do all the assignments and study moderately it will be guaranteed 90+
ham,Make sure to do all the assignments and this is a bird course.
ham,Very interesting topic unfortunately it does get rather dry at times.
ham,Teaches interesting trivia information about astronomy. Some calculations and physics. Not too in depth though.
ham,Open book exam 90% exam questions are from previous papers. Just take previous papers to the exam.
ham,Took it as a science elective. Fun and interesting course but the final was surprisingly difficult.
ham,If you take it online don't fall behind on the videos.
ham,Really enjoyed this course as a science elective. Gives a good overview of key concepts in astronomy. Not really a bird course so I wouldn't recommend this to people with no interest in the subject.
ham,Can learn the entire course the night beforethough I don't recommend it.... Math and Eng kids might prefer PHYS 175 as my impression is that its more math. This course was pure memorization.
ham,Trash useless course. For the online version make sure to get past finals and memorize the multiple choice and short answer to pass.
ham,Took as an online elective. It's a lot of boring space math. I was hoping it'd be a bit more interesting.
ham,-1 for the the mandatory textbook but I found content interesting (also bonus questions + slight final curve helped boost my mark)
ham,Horrible course though the prof contributed significantly to that. Completely arbitrary marking schemes no real teaching whatsoever
ham,I thought i would learn some cool shit about space but it was the prof reading off Pearson textbook slides. Also tests were quite difficult. Prob take another science course
ham,Take this course with Niayesh. Do not go to lecture. Only study this course the day before midterms/exams. Exams are open book. Easiest credit of my life.
ham,Very low effort course. Take it with Niayesh. Be aware that different profs have vastly different standards.
ham,Bird course with open book midterms and finals. Can't go wrong with it if you want to tick off a science elective.
ham,took this to tick off a science elective. all exams were open book so just print out the textbook/slides and search through them during the exam. v low effort
ham,Took online during W21. Prof was decent and content was interesting. Assignments midterms and final were all relatively easy if you brush up a bit on the content pretty easy 80 overall.
ham,Closed book exams so you have to memorize 20+ slideshows with 60+ slides each. Exams obscure material covered on one of these slides. Good luck!
ham,You can get away with not attending and getting notes from someone else. The seminar only runs when there is program-specific information that various instructors want to deliver to the cohort.
ham,Lots of cool examples and stories. Really interesting to listen to as well!
ham,The four topics were interesting. Took it online and wrote the essay to avoid 100% final.
ham,This course was very informative & very interesting! It had 2 midterms a paper and a final exam. Sometimes the content could be a bit graphic or disturbing but never overwhelmingly so.
ham,I took it online during covid. The grade consisted of 3 quizzes and final exam (short answer questions and an essay). One of my favorite courses very interesting content!
ham,Too few real programming examples but provides a good foundational understanding of data structures.
ham,Good class for programmers. Course was supposed to be focused on algorithms and we were pretty much just expected to know Java on our own which made it difficult for many...
ham,Basic overview of data structures algorithms. Those wanting to go in to CS related jobs will want quite a bit more from the course.
ham,The most important course for any technical interview.
ham,Super easy course if you've done any form of programming beyond SYDE 121. Probably the easiest course of 1B.
ham,This course is taught super well and the content flows really well. Do the assignments practice questions from Learn and attend the tutorials and you'll be fine.
ham,Very interesting course no final and very assignment and project-based. Moves a bit slow and usually in the morning so not the right choice if you're looking for something challenging.
spam,This course is terrible. Do not take it. This course is terrible. Do not take it. This course is terrible. Do not take it.
