      "This course now provides exemption to CICBV's level 1 and level 2 exams. Your exemption does not expire, and it's the highest exemption level in Canada. This is a huge advantage, you'd be stupid not to take this course. Sure, the textbook/handbook and registration license is a lot of money. But if you did your exam/studies through CICBV, it would be way more expensive. You save a lot of money from doing it with UW. This is the best course and the worthiest in the entire MAcc program. Also, unlike other courses where you don't really learn much new material, the CBV program is new knowledge and you'd be learning a lot. Valuation is an essential skill in both accounting and finance fields, and the CBV designation (plus its career aspects) is growing every year. By taking this course, you'd also be ready for CFE's valuation competency and really learn how to do a proper CCF/DCF. You're getting 3 designations' competencies (CPA, CFA, CBV) in 1 course. In undergrad, they never taught how to do a DCF (you just memorize the format from 373's cases). Many times, I wonder why this course can't be introduced earlier because it is actually that useful. "

      "I feel like this course is useful in terms of exam strategies, self-study, case debrief and getting ready for CFE. However, it is stretched too long in terms of the material. In the winter macc sessions, Greg goes over the stats (pass rates, competency areas, exam writing, admin stuff), and in spring, he goes over more of the stuff. I'd much rather focus on the technicals (like 611, 650, 680). Our students are really weak on day 3 cases and we've never had integrated cases, instead of talking about our feelings and bsing questions in-class, I much rather have discussions on FR issues (IFRS15, IFRS16 and IFRS9). Exam strategies and time management comes naturally when you understand the technical concepts and when you do more cases, but technical stuff we need the profs to help us. Greg is super strong in Assurance and I think it's really waste for him to ask everyone's feelings. Instead, we could focus on procedures/assertions (which everyone is weak at). The course itself isn't easy. The day 3 cases (Greg uses UFE) are killer. \n\nTLDR: we should have more technical discussions, less bs."

      "I fail to see how this course fits in the MAcc program. It's essentially an Online Course but I cannot gather any interests for it, since the readings, teachings, and assignments are useless. The readings do not reinforce the required work. I did all my assignments without having to read anything. The teachings were also not necessary since I did not attend a single lecture. The fact that there were literally no expectations for students to show up or care (since you're capped at 80%) is a big turnoff for students. The readings were lengthy, boring, outdated, and not interesting at all. Most assignments are full of typos and as if someone came up with them last minute. The entire course is focused on such a niche area of law, yet it's so simple that I can essentially do the entire course in 1 week. Most students did their submissions by the first half of the course, and did nothing (thus learned nothing) for the 2nd half, and the instructor made little efforts to make us learn. \n\nThe instructor fails to invoke our interests in the course and he doesn't care about our well-being either. Instructor refuses any regrades and claims that he's \"busy\" and declines meetings with students who wish to improve, despite only teaching 2 courses. If you cannot commit to teach (due to side projects or research), then don't teach. Our tuition in MAcc is high, and we do not want a course that adds no value to our professional careers. The students who marked our assignments and papers are not even Waterloo students. Fairness & objectivity in grading is a serious flaw in this course. There was absolutely no feedback provided when you get marks taken off. People often ask, \"are these TAs even qualified to mark our assignments\"? I bet as a MAcc student, we write better than them, yet they are taking marks off for grammar and other unknown reasons. Every class, MAcc students repeatedly complain to Charters that we don't understand his rationale of capping everyone at 80%. If we deserve a 100%, and there's no way to improve any further, then we deserve 100%. The forced distribution system placed upon the class really discourages the students who wanted to work hard. The students have the mentality that, \"no matter what you do, you're going to get a 80% anyways\". The students who do all the readings, spent hours researching and compiling, gets the same mark as a student who crammed everything in 1 hour. The lack of fairness further destroys any remaining value that is left in this course."

He works hard and tries his best to make sure everything is fair. We often see him updating stuff at midnight and his feedback documents were amazingly detailed.  Brad shows mercy to his students and curves the grades, despite it being not too bad in the first place. Compared to Berberich, I honestly thought we were lucky to have Brad who was excellent in every way in terms of teaching, and caring for his students. This course was not hard, yet you learn incredible amounts of FR and Assurance standards and case applications. It perfectly integrates with ACC611 standards and you essentially get extra practice on the FR issues while doing your weekly homework. I highly recommend taking 650 because it prepares you well for CFE, as opposed to PM or Finance. This course was highly organized by Brad, perfectly integrates with CPA material, and really increases your competency and depth in Audit. I hope Brad could teach more courses in the future."

      "If you think AFM433 is bs, then you DO NOT take this course! This is by far the most bs course I've ever taken in SAF, especially with Zamal teaching it. ACC685 is CPA elective and is supposed to be a much enhanced version of ACC680, yet Zamal only focuses on the strategy part and nothing on cost or quants and the course is entirely full of bs. A simple strategy case that could have been taught in 1 lecture is split into 3 full classes, you literally learn nothing. The cases are outdated, long, and made no sense (because it was not written for CPA purposes, but for MBA Harvard/Ivey)\n\nZamal is actually very lazy and he makes no effort in updating course material and claims that nothing has changed over the past 20 years and therefore we use the slides from 20 years ago. Also, he tries to bs his way out whenever he doesn't know the answers, which occurs often.\n\nMany of us took this course because we heard it was \"bird\". This is not the case this year. What happened is that Zamal was too lazy and he didn't change the midterm/final from the previous year, so the entire class from the year before got 90s. For our year, he totally screwed us over by making 2 hard cases for midterm and gave us all low marks for participation, assignment, and exams. By the way, he makes \"C\" only a 90%, so even if you get a \"C\" on your case, which is under CPA standards - perfect score, you won't get a 100% on your case. He's effectively capping your performance at 90% (max you'll get), and he makes RC a 70% when it's supposed to be a 75%. \n\nThis course DOES NOT help you prepare your CFE. If you think you're going to take PM role, then just spend more effort on 680 with Nancy and Janet because you learn more from them. There are not many PM role cases available since CFE started in 2015, but he makes no effort to make it better. He could have asked Nancy and used some of her cases or modified them, or just use CPA cases, but no, he just continued using the previous prof's cases because he's that lazy.\n\nHe also never replies his email, and never holds office hours (since he commutes). Good luck trying to reach him for help because he's not willing to. \n\nWould you still take a course that is difficult, where you learn nothing, and has nothing to do with CPA? Think twice before you enroll in this."

The iClicker and assignments are free marks. The exams weren't too difficult either. Other than bonds, I didn't spend a whole lot of time studying for the course and I got 95 in the course.

Midterm was too long but wasn't too hard. Our final however was a different story. It was much different from previous years as it was cased based which looks like that is going to be the trend from now on. So make sure you have a full understanding of the material and what it means. Many people found the final hard but I personally liked the case approach though it was somewhat hard.(Note the final relates to those in SAF sections ppl who are not in SAF had a non case based exam which was probably similar to the previous years)",

There is also one major assignment that took forever and is review of everything for midterm but was actually useful as a study tool.

I stopped attending lectures three weeks into classes and still got an 89 in the course so that's pretty telling.

But it is not a hard course, midterm and final are like normal homework each week. ",

I think the access code to the website is good enough, I ended up with a 97. \nDo all the practice on MyLab, they are useful!!!

Not to mention that our assessments are marked super hard as if this course wasn't some over-glorified English class that pretends to be mildly useful in the real world.\n\nBring back MATH 109",
      "This is a glorified English course but without actual literature, in other words, useless. The only thing this course taught me is that I don't enjoy reflections, which may have spurned from this course at this point. The grading doesn't make sense and the professors seem to enjoy the fact that this course gets low marks. For Kritik, the grading scale only spans 3 stars, so giving someone 2 stars is only 66%, the scale is just too small for accurate feedback. If I had known I would have to deal with this type of course I would have went to UfT instead, at least I wouldn't have had to lose all my braincells to learn nothing in return.   ",
      "To any future AFM students reading this, you will hate AFM 111. It is a glorified English class with useless business information sprinkled on top. Almost everything about this course is poorly made. The classroom on Learn is horribly organized and it takes forever to find anything. The lectures are next to useless and is a general waste of time. The inclusion of weekly reflections feel extremely forced and is easily the worst part of my week. AFM 111 also has the heaviest workload in all of 1A which is infuriating considering how tedious and empty the material is. I have not met a single person who has liked AFM 111 or has found its content even a little useful. The only good things I can say about this course is that it doesn't have any exams and that the profs aren't horrible. In fact, some of them acknowledge how pointless this all is. \n\nOverall, I'm shocked that this course is still a thing and that it replaced MATH 109. AFM 111 needs to be either removed or completely overhauled. Instead of trying to shove weekly reflections and goals down our throat, try making a course that students can actually benefit from. I didn't pay thousands of dollars to attend weekly HR meetings and write brain-dead reflections. \n\n\n",

The Breakdown is 10% Weekly Quizzes, 30% Individual Work, 30% Group Work, and 4 Cumulative Tests worth 7.5% each. Overall the content so far isn't bad but the quizzes were not great, instead of testing content from the week before, they tested content the week of, and the problem with that was that the quizzes opened up the middle of the week and closed on Friday, not enough time to learn the content well enough. Quizzes also still happened on midterm weeks. Assignments are pretty straightforward, basically similar to practice question I guess. Overall content isn't bad with practice, but the organization was all over the place. Also the annoying thing was that due to COVID the prof just gave us textbook readings for each module. TA's and Prof were also horrible at answering questions, the TA's gave us like 5 different answers for the same question. The term tests were super easy though, it would have minimum 30+ mc questions with at 3 bonus. ",
      "So you have a weekly quiz due every Friday, 3 group projects due every 3rd Wednesday, 3 individual projects due every 2nd Wednesday and every 4th Wednesday of the month you have an exam that is cumulative. ",
      "The online offering of this course is poorly organized. Make sure to keep on top of your stuff and do the practice questions.",
      "Really easy course, basically just grade 11 and 12 accounting. They made the course in a way where you pretty much have to get a good mark in along as you do everything. The quizzes started out hard but they became easier as time went on. I would say to just attend the lectures so you know whats going on. Overall easy and useful course. ",
      "This course is okay, I can definitely see it being useful for someone looking to prepare for an accounting career. The discussion posts are actually somewhat enjoyable",
      "bird",
      "Do not take as an elective unless you have prior knowledge from high school or if accounting is an interest. There are a few easier units but overall this course is difficult and requires you to reach back on previous units to understand present units. There are also a lot of readings and practice questions and a weekly quiz. Also a weekly team project and 4 discussion post assignments. ",
      "Accounting is boring, but the prof made it engaging and made class worthwhile. I really liked the structure and support of this course had. "

I found the assignment to be pretty cool, but the report at the end was kind of a pain. Teams are assigned at random, so don't think about teaming up with your friends. Midterm was all multiple choice, and the final was multiple choice and short answer questions. ",

Quizzes and most of the tests are MC, there are test banks too. Group project is pretty simple, but it does depend on what group members you get assigned with.

So your mark could be very low if the TA is mean. The solutions are very subjective also. It really depends on the marker's mood. \n\nAnother thing is that she does not provide solutions for cases. Neither does Manning. It would make sense that she doesn't want us to have the solutions so people come to class. But she doesn't post it AFTER class either. So essentially no one knows what the real case solution is and cannot practice effectively. What's worse is her participation marks. She never fking marks you. You don't get marks for just showing up in class, you have to talk. But she doesn't mark you down when you do. I ended up having a lower participation grade than the people who skip all her classes. It is so unfair. Perhaps I should have skipped all the classes so I get higher participation.",

      "This course was made to be extremely challenging, more challenging than it needed to be. The professors simply did not teach properly enough for students to do well on the exams. The content on TopHat was easy enough to understand, but did not help for doing the practice questions following it. The practice questions did not help prepare us for midterm or final. Tutorial sessions were also useless as those were also completely different to what was covered in the textbook and practice questions. Additionally, we were not give additional practice for the midterm or final. Basically everything in the course was unrelated to each other, and the professors themselves would constantly contradict each other adding even more inconsistency. Even if you do the practice questions multiple times and think you understand what's going on, the midterm will prove you wrong. This course was a mess, very disorganized and extremely unclear in what was expected of us as there were so many different types of questions that could be asked, but we were never actually taught how to solve any of them. Not to mention the fact that we were told several times that the final exam would be 2 hours, even the sheet given to us at the exam said 2 hours..... then right before we started, the proctors told us that is was actually 1.5 hours and there's nothing we can do about it. I don't understand how they could mess that up?? Anyways, the only people who did well in this course were those who make finance their life, and had previous private equity internships (had real experience making DCFs). Everyone else was doomed. Passing this course was a miracle honestly. There is so much more I can say about this god forsaken course, but you get the idea. I hope they change the way this course is taught for future AFM students, because if the professors continue to teach as awfully as they did, all you can do is pray for a curve."

In fact, it was way too easy that people keep on bsing in class and it was quite difficult for the prof to pick you.

As a MAcc alumni, she wants to integrate a lot of real-life situations and cases into the course. It is quite useful to have to research and apply to real life situations. But she did not emphasize a lot on textbook use. You can pretty much skip the entire term and still do well on the cases by researching yourself. Thing about cases is that, it cannot cover every possible topic. I feel like I did not get to learn a lot of things that may have been important, but since there were literally no evaluation on them, no one did the readings or cared about it. Most students don't do any prep work and still did really well in the course.

The expectations and rubric for the assignments are extremely vague and thus it is near-impossible to meet the standard of the TAs and get good marks.

      "Contrary to what others say, Linda has a unique way of caring for students. She appears to be grumpy and harsh on purpose but she is really very nice and wants her students to do well. Her teachings are really good and she explains things very well. Her experiences and knowledge are vast and will always give you a satisfactory answer if you ask her questions. One thing I'd like to complaint though, she's almost too nice that those (and every class there are some) annoying kids always just ask stupid questions to gain participation marks. Participation was only 5% for our year but she would never stop the stupid people from asking stupid questions, it wastes a lot of class time and people get really annoyed in this class because of these people. So if you are one of  those, don't do it.\n\nAside from that, she would intentionally rekt you on the midterm (avg around 50%-60%), but then curve you after the final. Audit was actually one of the highest marks in 3B so do not panic if you failed the midterm, it's meant to be low. She does this so you would work hard for the finals. \n\nCourse material wise, textbook is quite useless but it is what she base her materials from. I'd say you would still need it, but don't try to memorize the terms. Do the cases. They help a lot. Stay up for them cases and you need those Competents to make up for your low midterm. Overall, this is a great course that teaches you the entire audit cycle from the beginning to the end. You may not like it because it is very case based, but hey that's how CFE is and you need to get used to this type of learning.",
      "Not a bad course. Teaches you about the theory of audit. Exams are case based so make sure you understand the topics and know how to apply them. If you worked in audit during co-op this course should not be hard at all."

      "Like the other guy said, do the assignments before class. They're basically free marks and really help you remember the concepts you learn.",
      "There's a lot of free marks from handing in hwk problems (10%), course summary and news article (10%) and participation (10%). Tip for participation: they say that \"saying 2 things per class warrants a good mark\" but that's a lie. If you only say 2 things, that will only get you a 75% for participation. \n\nThe midterms are very doable (usually 80% average) but their marking scheme is bad. Basically you get your paper back with a lot of checkmarks (up to 64 checkmarks per big question). They add the checkmarks up, then multiply it by the \"weight\" of the question to get your mark. REAL EXAMPLE from my MT: Let's say you get 45 checkmarks out of 64 total checkmarks. If the question is worth 27 points (27%) out of 100 point and checkmarks are weighted at 0.42, then you do 45 checkmarks*0.42 = 19 marks/ 27 marks. See how UNNECESSARY that is? If they state that the question is worth 27 points out of 100 on the front page of my midterm, why on earth do they need to come up with the checkmark grading system? It would make much more sense for me to only see 27 possible checkmarks on my midterm. \n\nIt is so difficult to see where you lost marks because all you see are checkmarks. Also, they don't do CF marks. If you miss a number, your ending balance will be off and you won't see any checkmarks there..\n\n",

For example, calculation of Employment Income, Business Income, employment vs. self-employed will all be taught again, in more details. For example, you learn about traveller's and commission income for EI, you would learn more credits to use. Some of the things that we focused on in 362 will be less important here such as stock options benefit, auto benefit, what to include/exclude for employment income...and so on. \n\nAfter the midterm, however, many new concepts were introduced and it was so crammed with so many new things that the course was quite hard to catch up on. Something like AOC, Associated Corps, SRED, income vs. capital, could really be difficult to understand. For these new concepts, there were only like 1 practice question per concept (and the question is hard), so it's really hard to study for them. \n\nYou really need to do your questions. The second part of the course was focused on concepts and our final had like no calculation (calculators weren't needed near the end). It was very strange. Midterm was a lot of calculation though. For your final, you need to memorize everything and take good notes on what he says in class. You really have to go to class.\n\nFinally, Rogo snaked us in the end. We all dropped like 10%. Maybe the average was too high (76% for midterm), or the assignments average was too high, he marked our final exams really hard. The final was really easy but the average was probably around 60%. Rogo is normally nice and the average for 362 was quite high, no one really expected him to pull this on us. He really screwed up our MAcc average.",

Concepts before midterm seemed okay in class, but what frustrated me the most was the professor never posting solutions claiming it would be \"copyright infringement.\" WTF? So he literally gave us 2 seconds to write down the solution and simultaneously try and listen to his reasoning and move through the material as fast as possible. Poor move, considering the \"copyright infringement\" excuse is probably just a reason for him not to post and drop everyone's marks as a result. With such smart people I have no idea why you would do this - maybe it's the program's \"business model.\""

In a sense, it's like an advanced version of AFM211, with less financial focus, but more on the overall business. It's quite interesting to be honest. But the thing with these  kinds of case course is that it's quite subjective. Your TA plays a big role in this course. If you're unlucky and got a hard TA for midterm/final, then you're pretty much screwed. Also, Mark is not very knowledgeable with financials, so he tends to bs a  lot on that portion, yet he expects us to do like legit NPV and financial analysis on the exam, which was also kind of unfair. I remember in class he was like, \"if you don't have enough information to make a legit financial analysis, then just say not enough info given, and say what you would have done given XX information\". We all did that for the midterm, and he gave us all 50% because you guys didn't do legit financials, when there isn't enough information, you just guess/assume. We were all like wtf.

It's  too much for a student who doesn't plan on pursuing a tax-based career, and a lot of what you learn will be heavily automated anyways. So there really is no point in it. It should have been a Master's elective. Whoever designed this course is ridiculous - basically the profs spend 95% of lecture time taking up problems that could have easily been self-taught if you had access to the solutions. But wait! The profs don't post the solutions because \"they'll get in trouble\" - which is even more ironic considering that one of the profs WROTE the book! Another glaring flaw is the participation weighting. Essentially you have to properly participate in class 4-5 times to earn the full mark, which is pretty much impossible because the class acts like a hunger games arena anyways. Oh, and the people who take down your participation are the students themselves, so that's also another control deficiency! Profs themselves literally cannot pick all the students 5 times each lecture too, and they tend to pick the same people to answer the questions anyways.

There is no textbook for this course; the only required readings are 2 papers per week. Be wary this course has historically been a 3-hour course on a Thursday night.\n\nOverall, although you do get to learn a few new trading strategies (which may or may not be profitable now) and how to use Bloomberg (for those of you not in the SIF already), I had higher expectations of this course going in as I expected to learn more and actually be taught by the professor, rather than by students (some of whom don't do a good job at thinking about the implications of the papers).

      "They say this is a continuation to AFM373, but this course is way easier. I think when Blake and Ecclestone taught this before, it was actually hard, but with Alan Huang and JAD, it's not that bad. The only problem is, it's too easy and the things you learn are too useless. 373 focused a lot on valuations, DCF, synergies and financial modelling. This course was purely theoretical and bsing. Our final exam on derivatives, had no derivatives in it and was rather a strategies case like AFM433. While in equities from Alan Huang we learned some interesting theories, they are not that practical in real life. Ecclestone would let students do stock simulations and so on, this course has none of those practical applications. It almost feels like they try too hard not to teach students finance (knowing this is for CPA students), it seems like we didn't learn much in this course. \n\nPresentations take up way too much time. Students are just not paying attention whenever people are presenting, there's nothing to do. Yet we should have spent that time wasted on actually learning finance. Peer critiquing was a big problem too. People just snake each other no matter how well you do. This course is very disorganized and you honestly don't learn any finance. If you are actually interested, take 424 + 322. This course is rushed in a way that you don't even get to go too deep on any topic. Derivatives was especially plain. All the hedging stuff you learned from AFM121. Grading was also very subjective. When you are at 4B, the people who mark your finance cases are \"industry professionals\". But they are very unprofessional when they mark stuff, taking marks off for things such as no page numbers, formatting, or font size. \n\nMarks wise it is ok. Everyone got around high 70s to 80s. The profs are nice too. It's just that the course itself is not very useful. They honestly should just make AFM students mandatory taking afm424 and 322. CPA  has changed, and a crash course like 479 is no longer relevant for newer afm students who have many electives to spare.",

The midterm and final was so hard that averages for midterm was around 50% and final was around 30%. But they refused to curve and lied about class average, claiming it's 72% for the midterm.

We did a lot of practice questions on cost accounting, but exams are all bs questions, it won't matter if you study or not. Final exam was a huge variance question that accounted for more than half of the exam. Their objective was to make sure we don't make MAcc. \n\nLynn Carty was the worst. She is not qualified to teach, she doesn't know her stuff at all.

While that may be a joke, we didn't even find it remotely entertaining. She wants everyone to fail because she is pissed that she never made AFM back in UW.

    "description": "This course will introduce students to mental health and wellness across the life span, with an emphasis on the postsecondary age group. AHS 105 considers mental health within the broader spectrum of health in our changing world. Through this course, students will increase their ability to recognize, manage, and strengthen mental health. Students will develop greater awareness of their own mental health and wellness through the application of the knowledge and skills learned in this course. In addition to considering mental health at the individual level, this course will focus on how to foster a culture of support and caring in community. This course is not intended to be a substitute for counselling.",
    "reviews": [
      "One of my favourite courses at UW. It was easy (90+), interesting, and helpful. Definitely try to take this course in your first couple of years.",
      "Insanely easy, this class honestly felt comforting and I learned a lot about mental health. Assignments were basically to practice self-care and reflect on it, and no midterm or exam. Take it!",
      "(Took this course online) It's a pretty easy course, a lot of the stuff you get to learn about yourself and mental wellbeing. As long as you are a person who is understanding towards others, you'll do fine. Quizzes are a mix of mc and short answer. ",
      "Easy course for 70 (just like any other course to be honest).\nIf you want 80+, you do need to spend much more time, which I did not because fuck it. I'd add that this course is very TA dependent course as well. But we had them rotating, so there was one TA was who was very nice and the other Chinese TA who did not give a fuck. ",
      "Like other reviews here it was pretty straightforward content, 3 quizzes every 4 weeks, 4 discussion activities, and a Mindfulness project that spans through the term that is pretty easy to do as well. However it isn't like a I won't put any effort in and I'll do fine, you'll still wanna put some effort in the discussions and project since they are meant to be reflections to get a good mark. For the assignments what happened is that it was split into multiple parts and the issue I had each part would be marked by a different TA or the Professor so some mark harder some mark easier. This was the same case for group work so I got hella low marks on some of them. Kinda up to luck whether you get the easier TA for the heavier weighted parts I guess.",
      "The prof is honestly very good and understanding, but the course information was not the greatest interest to me, i think it really depends on your TA's as mine were quite picky, i wouldnt say this is a super bird course like clas 104, theres 3 quizzes (worth like 14% each) they were alright, the class average for them were low 70s, content itself was eh, theres a bunch of reflection writing/discussion posts which imo are not that bad, but its mainly the quizzes imo that are rough cause its worth so much and the questions are pretty tricky so you gotta go through the modules very well",
      "The course was very well organized and the personal mental wellness project was one of the best projects I've done in my undergrad. Basically helps you find wellness strategies that work for you.",
      "A course that is easy to get high marks in but not easy to excel in. Requirements were subjective and ambiguous, and lots of readings. A lot of the course is linking to external resources, and I do not agree with a lot of concepts that were taught in this course. ",
      "I actually quiet liked the content in the course. I think it was extremely useful and helpful. It talks a lot about your own mental health as well as others. I've always struggled with communication and how to respond to someone when they get serious, so this course really helped with that! The quizzes are fairly easy, just do the readings and the modules and you're set. An extremely insightful class. No final exam or midterm or term tests, just three quizzes. I'd just say that feedback for assignments could have gone a bit more in depth. Sometimes, there wouldn't be anything written, just the rubric, so you'd have to reach out to get the specifics. The assignments due dates were extremely flexible, you get five grace days for the big projects, which was nice. ",
      "Not as bird as you might think, assignments were marked fairly hard. ",
      "Overall, I would consider this a bird course. It was really useful, and you focused on your own mental health for a change. It was 4 quizzes followed by an ongoing mental wellness project focused on your own mental health, and some activity posts (like 3 of them). The work-load was very minimal, definitely take this during a stressful term to ease up your workload, and also better yourself. The quizzes themselves were open book and mostly involve testing course content, if you lightly trimmed through readings you can get an idea for how to answer the questions during the quiz for the reading ones. Quizzes were mostly multiple choice followed by 1-2 short answer, you had MORE THAN enough time to finish the quizzes. \n\n"

Dr. Wilson was passionate about the class, but read from the slides directly (which were from the readings directly) which made going to class feel tedious.",

      "Stupidly easy class. Never went and got a mark in the 90s. His lectures are straight out the readings. The tutorials however are nonsense. The mandatory attendance is a garbage rule, if you lose marks for not going that's one thing, but failing the whole component if you miss 2 is absurd. If you get a good TA though it's not terrible, mine let us skip the dumb assignments which was helpful, though I know some TAs made their class stay the whole 90 minutes even if there was nothing left to do. ",
      "Honestly, it was a super fair course everything for midterms was straight from the slides. Look over the readings and get the main gist of it tho cuz they're kinda asked on the midterms. TA's for this course are probably the nicest you'll ever meet and will provide extra help or look over you papers for pointers and corrections. They're probably the best part of this course. ",

However, one good thing is that there is tons of opportunity to be able to improve your grade (this is from a fall 2020, online perspective). The TAs are super kind and Wade, the instructor, will try his best to be flexible (ex: extending deadlines for assignments). ",
      "This course was unbearably easy. Most of the content is common sense. However, make sure you do the readings because there are questions that specifically correlate to them. ",
      "Information is general and generic.\n\nIt's a good filler course- just make sure not to forget to hand in tutorials or hand in things late. As long as you hand it in and it fits the criteria expect a high grade. \nYou gotta read the readings cuz some Q's/assignments are specifically from them.",
      "This is an easy course with two quizzes, a position paper, and small weekly tutorial assignments (online). I didn't find it that useful because everything is pretty much all common sense and overlapped with other courses.",
      "*Taken remotely due to COVID* Honestly didn't watch any of the lecture videos as the professor just read right off of them, as long as you do the readings and review the slides you'll be fine.",
      "I showed up to class, took good notes and was able to do really well in the course. If you pay attention and do the readings you'll do great. There was a paper, a midterm and a final exam. ",
      "If you skim the readings and pay attention to his lectures (which are not very difficult) it's an easy class. Some of the concepts repeat throughout the course, so once you get a feel of it, you'll be fine. ",

Organized in a strange way, such that only pseudocodes were talked about in class, but students are expected to write some \"fancy and cool codes\" on themselves. Seems like the coding languages have changed several times, from Matlab to Python (which is used in Spring22). Read the syllabus in advance to know which language will be used and plan accordingly.",

I expected more coding and an understanding of computational math, but what I got was a review of math 136/235 and a lot of annoying formulas. The lectures were pointless and exactly the same thing as reading the textbooks. Overall, not a difficult course, but I wish it was more interesting. ",
      "Crammed a lot of topics into one course so that none of them could be explained adequately. Unfortunate because I think it could have been a really cool course. Some MatLab but lots of tedious computations that took way too much time and poorly written proofs. Way too much time was spent on easy concepts and then difficult concepts and proofs were glossed over and unclear. The content shouldn't have been too hard but the way the prof wrote assignments and tests was unclear and they always seemed to want one specific non-obvious explanation. I wish I had taken a different course. ",
      "Assessments included 4 assignments worth 8% each, midterm 28%, final 40%. The assignments included both written and coding components (in Matlab) and all assessments were pretty fair. One of the assignments included a Matlab project, but it wasn't so bad. We were allowed to bring a cheat sheet to the midterm and final but it was hard to study for since we were not given any extra practice problems. Also, the material is very dry (especially the floating point number stuff) and doesn't seem very useful. Didn't really attend lectures since the prof tended to mumble to herself and went so fast that I couldn't follow what she was saying, but all lecture notes were provided on Learn. The TAs were also on top of things: they gave us a Matlab tutorial at the beginning of the term, and there were special office hours held for each assessment in the term. Overall, there is so much content to be covered that we didn't get to learn anything in-depth, but I guess that makes sense for an introductory course.",
      "Despite all the negative reviews, I liked this course for some reason. Lots of different stuff covered in the course, lots of manual computations expected with some proofs. I don't see how this is listed as a CS course, as it is very mathematical in general. Assignments were honestly fun to work on, but the exams kinda caught me off guard with regards to which course concepts we should have lots of knowledge of. Was also cool to use Matlab i guess. I would for sure not call this a bird course, but its not too too difficult or work-intensive either; you can probably do well if you never attend a lecture and read off the annotated slides",

There were some trickier topics to do with applications of DEs that depart from the 'easy' formulaic routines. The applications were definitely the hardest part of the course, especially for someone with a weak physics background, but it was manageable. This course is fairly easy to do well in if you put in the work to practice the material. The only downside was the lack of piazza and minimal office hours.",
      "The basic solving a DE stuff is pretty straight-forward once you understand all the methods but pay close attention bc this course definitely takes a turn. Solutions are gate-kept so its easy to lose motivation to practice but I wish I did more because the long worded application questions (using physics, circuits etc.) bit me in the ass every time. ",
      "We had weekly assignments worth 1% each, 2 quizzes worth 6% each, midterm 25%, final 55%. The weekly assignments varied in terms of length and difficulty but the worst part was that there was no Piazza to ask questions on, because sometimes I had no clue what the questions were even asking. The quizzes were fine, but the exams always had a \"challenge\" question at the end which were difficult and really tested your understanding. I felt like I had to attend every lecture since not all lecture notes were posted to Learn. The prof generally made things easy to understand and we did many examples during lectures. The course notes have so many practice problems to study from which was a blessing.",
      "Personally, I thought it was a lot harder than it was made out to be. Midterm was intentionally difficult on the integral side so definitely don't dismiss them. A lot of work volume but the work itself is not extremely difficult. Course requires a lot of pulling information from word questions which is good for science students but could be more difficult for math student like myself.

If you can follow the lectures and do the assignments, you\u2019ll do fine!",

Prof. Waite's online lectures were engaging and intuitive, though Taylor's Classical Mechanics textbook goes a bit more in depth, which supplements the lectures well. Prof. Waite was very active on Piazza and with emails as well. Assignments can be tough sometimes but the deadlines are super reasonable, and grading is usually fair. Computational aspect of the course is cool too. Overall great experience!",

The breakdown was 4 quizzes worth 7.5% each, and midterm/final worth 35% each (all fully online). It was pretty easy to do decently well (70-80%) by just skimming the textbook. However, it was much harder to get 90+ since there were also very specific questions on the lecture videos, which were long and packed with info.",

I mostly relied on the textbook and skimmed though the lecture videos (although Mark Dolson's lectures are very entertaining if you have the extra time to watch them). Pretty good bird course, can be a bit dry though. I definitely could have gotten a better mark if I put more effort into it, but you can really easily get an 80+ without spending much time on it ",
      "Personally, I find anthro to be very boring. I have no interest in this course and simply needed a CSE to graduate. So if you're like me and many others who need to take courses outside of your interests to simply graduate, I don't recommend anthro if you're aiming to have this as a mark booster. Without watching lectures or having the textbook, you can achieve somewhere between a 60-75. Many questions involve very small details from the recordings and textbook. So small and specific, details of where the prof did his field research was on the final. To achieve a high mark, you need to put effort in watching the lectures and reading parts of the textbook. Textbook could not be found free anywhere. The midterm and final had 1 short-answer. I didn't even bother writing anything for it. I had no anthro knowledge. To answer these questions, you need to watch the lecture and read the textbook.",
      "The content was fairly interesting, and it was very minimal efforts. Only thing is that its essential that you go to the lectures. Besides that, theres like 4 assignments throughout the semester that take an hour max to do. Mid-term and exam are very fair as long as you made good notes on lectures. ",
      "Anth100 is definitely an interesting and easy course. I took it last semester and got 94. The course consisted some quizzes, one midterm and final, and the questions were straight-forward multiple choice and 1 short answer. Make sure to watch the videos posted by instructor since some questions were extracted from lectures.",
      "a quiz each week, along with a multiple choice midterm and exam. The quizzes were open book and working with classmates was encouraged which was fantastic. They weren't difficult. This class goes over the basics of anthropology, which was super fascinating. ",
      "First half with Alexis was interesting, second half with Mark not as interesting for me, and his lecture recordings were pretty all-over-the-place. Fiddling with lecture notes on the fly, not cutting out phone calls and arguments with his kids from the video, etc. Worst part was several final exam questions were based on things only said in lecture videos which in itself is fine, but instead of testing content/ideas that were video-exclusive, they tested super specific one-off stuff that I can't imagine anyone would take notes on (like \"who said this one specific quote that was mentioned once in lecture\"-type questions, etc.)",
      "Loved this course. Readings were engaging and Hayes did a good job in covering all the content. Lectures were reasonable, just had to pay attention and take notes and you were good. Midterm and final were reasonably challenging, nothing unexpected for an exam."

Spent a very long time about the history of evolution and it's social context, but no time about things such as genetic mutations.\nThe examples were mostly irrelevant, many things were common sense, a very boring course. Contains 2 midterms and an exam. The prof. expects random details about who created which disproved theory and when, no clear info on what will be on the exam, no review for exams, no practice quizzes, nothing. Made no mentions of any readings until the class before the midterm. Lecture notes only comprised of one or two words per slide, it's a disaster.",
      "Two 30% midterms and a 40% final, but the multiple choice questions can be really specific about minor details, and had less to do with the major concepts discussed in class. Speaking of which, while some of the concepts in class could have been cool, it contained a lot of memorization on taxonomy and where/when/what purpose archaeological site #43 had. Going to lectures was a waste of time as well, the prof would put up slides with a title and no elaborating text, and then give a poor explanation of the topic. I think she was new at teaching, as she appeared nervous. That's not an excuse for poor slides and lack of answers when it came to midterm content.  Could have been a cool course, but the execution wasn't really all there. I was looking for a bird course and wanted to learn a little about anthropology, and I got neither. Not a difficult course, but frustrating."

",
      "This course is pretty hard  and I originally took it as one of the requirements for my minor. Bad choice. I am not an anthro major and this was an extremely small class with only around 15 people and most of them are in the anthro department. Aside from this, Prof Liu is a good teacher but a hard marker. In terms of assignments, the weightings and subjectivity are quite unfair that it's really difficult to earn a good mark in this course. Participation accounted for 20% of your mark, and despite that I never missed a class, and participate in discussions, I did not get a good mark. I am baffled by the subjectivity of this course and how the assignments are marked. I usually don't understand why I lose marks and overall it accumulates to my overall bad mark. I am disappointed. In terms of course content, it is quite similar to sociology but the readings are lengthy written by anthropologists that are difficult to read and at the same time hard to write. If you would like to explore social issues and the themes written in the description, I suggest you take SOC or something else. Finally, the prof is nice and a good presenter which makes the small class bearable, but that doesn't matter if your mark is bad. They removed the pre-reqs for this course and I expect this class to get larger and different profs will be teaching it, so your experience may be different. My recommendation is, don't take this course if you're not ANTH major/minor, and take it only if you don't care about GPA.",

Was with Dr. Liu and was told there would be a presentation which would count for participation marks..... thankfully this just never happened. Very little is actually taught/learned, it is almost entirely class discussion on poverty/racism/ etc. Papers are marked fairly, and the midterm was a take-home. There is no final exam for this course. ",

He memorized our names so when he gave our tests back he just handed them out. He encourages and stimulates class discussion for those who wish to participate and his personal narratives and experiences with societal issues to make this course so interesting that going to class will NOT feel like a chore but a reward.; BUT pay attn in class bc some of the bonus questions will come from the most random thing -- get those grades ",

      "Genuinely interesting elective that covers 2(?) CS Breadth and Depth requirements. Beginning was a little slow as others have mentioned covering very basic topics like the scientific method and fundamentals of evolution, but after the first couple of weeks picks up quite a bit and goes into a lot of detail about primate evolution. Last 2 weeks of the course again slows significantly covering broader anthropological topics like human typology & ethics. The beginning of the course may mislead you, unless you're well versed on these topics you *will* need to put in significant effort and go to lectures in order to do well on the quizzes. A lot of memorisation required. Whether you're taking this as an elective or to fulfil a mandatory requirement, I would recommend it though.",
      "Liston's passion for the subject is infectious. I took her class in Fall 2022. There were just three terms, or \"midterms\" as she calls them. She tests more on her lecture content, with the textbook being supplemental but not ignorable. There are many terms, peoples, and timelines to remember. Her tests consists of MC, T/F, fill-in-the-blanks, and short answers. You also need to pay attention to pictures used in slides as you may be required to identify skeletons and artifacts. You don't need a biology background to do well in this class. As long as you put in the effort in memorizing and attend class, you will do fine."

All tests, including the midterm and final exam, are online and open book, which is amazing (take good notes! it will help you so much). You read three books throughout the term and it's expected that you will read them in approx. two weeks, unless you are able to start early, which I did not love. I can read a book in a day if I have nothing on my schedule, but when I have five classes, getting through a 300-400 page book in time for the term paper (which you will do in October/November) or the tests is difficult. This course is an elective for the INDG studies minor, which is why I took it, and I felt like it was enlightening. Inuit peoples and cultures are frequently glossed over in INDG Studies classes. I'd say that if you want to peer into a completely different culture, out of sheer interest or otherwise, this is a good course. "

I genuinely feel as though this class, or others like it, should be mandatory for all students to take because it is amazing how ignorant many people(including myself prior to taking this class) are to the history of oppression and discrimination that the indigenous populations have faced. Overall, taking this class was an extremely rewarding experience and I would highly recommend taking it to anyone that has the opportunity to do so! Difficulty-wise this class was relatively easy to do well in and consisted of 3 response papers, 10% each (opinion based and open book); a group project (30%); 10 % participation; and a final paper (30%). The papers and group project were marked fairly and the work load was relatively small. ",
      "This is definitely a course filled with information that should be taught to all students even before they enter university. Looking back at Canada's colonial past and really understanding the racist roots was eye-opening. The course was divided into 8 quizzes (best 6/8 for final mark), a 40% final and 40% group project. The course material was good just the prof was completely unorganized. Lecture material was just discussed and it wasn't apparent what was important/useful. We were told on the syllabus we would write 8 quizzes and only 6 were given, which gave some confusion. The midterm was fair, though it was all short answers. The group project was frustrating in that as a result of lack of time and planning, some groups did not feel rushed while others had to stay 25 minutes past class in order to present for about 3 minutes because group members had other commitments. It was unfair how some students didn't have to worry about this while other groups did, and this was 30% of the final mark. Overall, the course material is great just lack of organization made for a frustrating semester "

I enjoyed the aspect of doing fieldwork, taking fieldnotes, etc. but the assignments were a whole different story. We did not receive outlines, nor were we given clear instructions of what was expected us. The assignments were then marked quite harshly and we received little feedback on how we could improve our work.I somehow managed to pull off an 81 in the course, but i feel as though I, as well as others I talked to in the class, couldve done better is we knew what was expected of us. So, in general, I did not enjoy this class as much as I had hoped but the experience of going out and doing fieldwork was useful. This is the first time this course has been offered though, and based on complaints from people in my class, I feel as like the structure of the class will be subject to change and expectations will be made more clear. next time.

The more you read, the more you realize you have no idea what to do.  It's AMAZING! Then, a group of TAs who have been 'trained to understand the rubric' (triggered yet?) determine to mark your assignments in a way that scrutinizes even the most simple of activities. \n\nI have so much more exciting things to share... But Lorelai is so nice, so I shall refrain. \n\n",

      "Gonna write this cause the last review was like 3 years ago. Honestly, I found this class so difficult compared to ARBUS 200/300 especially with the online format. I'm not a business major so this may be a major reason why I found it incredibly stressful. Each week you come together to make a bunch of decisions about a business you are running, and honestly it's stressful since you get assigned your own department (R&D, Marketing, Production, or Finance) to manage. Overall I think it was just so tiring (especially as an introvert) because basically, the entire class is weekly group work. The breakdown is like 35% Individual (presentation and modules) stuff and 65% group work (forecast model, 2 presentations and balance scorecard that depends on how well you do in the simulation so you can't just mess around). I find that it is a lot to keep track of especially if you're a full-time student, there is a lot for an online course, but it does simulate like a real-life business experience. Also capsim is kinda dumb like it's a lot of guesstimating honestly, and the way it calculates things are weird too. He says you are required to attend lectures butttt I found them useless and fell asleep anyways soo I stopped going half-way through the term, he should record them too so eh.

      "Pretty easy as long as you do your assignments on time and go to all classes, easy 70 or 80 if you take leisurely approach to the course.",
      "very easy, just a bit boring",
      "My section was kinda boring but not too bad for a required course. I just don't like essays. Sylvia is great, very nice prof but a hard marker ",
      "I took the Black History course. It was very informative and helped me understand more about the history of racism and some controversial topics. ",
      "Super easy and enjoyable if you enjoy writing and are fairly strong at it. Topics are interesting as well.",
      "Dr. Shana MacDonald was very accommodating and showed great enthusiasm for learning about her students. \n\nThe course materials and readings were very informative and could be applied to various other courses and real-world experiences.   \n\nI would highly recommend this course for formal thesis writing! \n\nARTS 130 - What do You Meme?",
      "Really good intro course. It really depends on what topic you choose though. I took What Do You Meme? which was really fun and engaging.",
      "The essays themselves were fun and challenging. The thinking pieces on the other hand were not so fun. Being marked out of 5 is never good, and can be an easy 60 if you score a 3/5. Students all agree her feedback is very limiting. 3-4 word replies that are rather unhelpful. Slow marker. ",
      "Did a lot of good creative exercises but never got drafts returned early enough to change things before the final copy was due.",
      "Took ARTS 130 (the Conspiracies class) and it is definitely one of my top favourite classes. Although my prof could have been a bit better, the content is something you can learn yourself.",
      "The course was interesting, spoke of philosophers, freedom, law, and one of the readings was a comic book. arts 130 freedom and unfreedom is the name. few readings, some assignments,",
      "the course was entirely useless. Readings were pointless and had no relation to the assignments. Lectures were a waste and had no benefit. Prof marked very strictly. there are some group assignments and speeches to present as well. ",
      "Was a very interesting class with assignments that were really engaging. would definitely recommend it. I took the Arts 130 \"Shut up and dribble\" which is very appealing if you are interested in sports and concepts such as intersectionality, anti-racism, and CRT, as this course is mainly about understanding how those concepts relate to sports and how we view sports.  ",
      "I took Consent and Commitment online, it was very boring and mostly self-taught. I did not like the content and I didn't learn anything new. There were many assignments and the final essay was long.",
      "Basic communication course catered towards whichever topic you're taking. I took Non-binary Digital Storytelling and quite enjoyed the course. The assignments included a presentation, formal essay, peer review, zine, and text-based game. All around a cool course with a cool instructor.",
      "I took Arts 130: Pop Culture with the BEST professor at Waterloo Sorouja Moll. The content was interesting, I ended with a 96. I will say this is a heavy partner based so make sure you have a good partner. There were 5 reading reviews, each worth 10%. Great course, I learned a lot and had amazing discussions. ",
      "The content of this course was very theoretical and philosophical so if that's your type of thing then you'll enjoy this class (i, however, did not). If you can, don't take this as a morning class. I had this as an 8:30 and found myself dreading every second of it",
      "The ARTS 130 courses are not particularly useful in providing the communication and inquiry skills that they say that they do. It highly depends on the professors that you get. These are skills that you will naturally acquire as you write more papers, there was no particular benefit in taking these particular courses.\n\nThe topic that I had for ARTS 130 was Friendship which was incredibly interesting and fun to talk about each week. In addition, I actually felt like I was learning by the end of the course. I really enjoyed the topic, but the actual course was not particularly helpful.",
      "The course material itself was very engaging and interesting, in my opinion. Although the assignments themselves were pretty work intensive, they were still interesting. ",
      "Taught about philosophy, related to LS 101 not gonna lie. Still unsure if we are truly free. Had 4 essays, 1 group and 1 oral presentation. Prof was nice and funny.",
      "It really depends on your prof for this course but the topic Extreme Writing was the worst course I've taken. The workload was heavy and the prof, Dennis Lewis, was rude, discouraging and spoke in a manner that was really difficult to understand. Bi-weekly quizzes and discussion posts, a group seminar, four essays (two with submitted rough drafts as a separate mark) and an annotated bibliography. This course was the most draining and tedious please avoid at all costs.",
      "I think that the topic for this course heavily determines whether or not it'll be fun/easy or not, seeing that the different instructors structure the course and the assignments differently. I did Nonbinary Digital Storytelling with Chris Lawrence, and it was honestly one of the highlights of my week. We got to discuss video games and critical binaries within those games, and the in-class discussions were always so fun. The assignments were also all pretty lowkey, and weren't too difficult to manage or to get a good mark on. Overall, I had a lot of fun in this course! The content was interesting and Chris was super cool :)",
      "Old guy, nice, marked decently soft. Liked his anecdotes like that story of how he damaged his hearing by turning on some boombox. This topic was Canadian Literature: Canlit In Ruins which tbh, I picked cuz I no other choice so I was pretty bored lol. ",
      "Exploring Technocultures with Brianna Wiens\nI liked Brianna as a person very much but didn't like the course.\nI found the course little loaded/biased. Also its weekly readings are too lengthy despite of their great content quality.\nBut overall the course is not too challenging.",
      "Non-Binary Storytelling \nFun course about games and Chris is super chill and easy going. In this course, you play and make simple games about binaries. If you are passionate about gaming, you'd appreciate this course. I've only ever been  a Nintendo/Minecraft kid, but this course made me view games in a different way. ",
      "Another useless arts first course that supposed to help but just makes everything harder. There is no actual support or learning in this class, it just shouldn't be mandatory. If someone wants to subject themselves to this willingly then that's their prerogative. Online especially, I did hear that some in person sections were okay, but not all. ",
      "I took the Consent and Communication topic and honestly your enjoyment in ARTS 130/140 is based on the topic you choose. The content was interesting for my topic and we had so many meaningful conversations. The direction of the course was unclear sometimes but we ended up doing about 7 (?) 1-2 page writings on whatever the discussion was throughout the course. At the end we did a 7 page paper (2100 words) that was worth about 25% of our grade. ",
      "Prompts for assignments were all over the course page and couldn't be all found in one document or place. Emails weren't responded to. Feedback for assignments took way too many weeks for the feedback to be considered useful. Individual course checkin was scheduled during my classtime for another course. When concerns about course organisation were raised to Prof Ezeh he simply brushed them off.  \n\nTLDR: Don't waste your time and go for another section."

      "Useless course.",
      "Most useless course I've ever taken.",
      "Your experience with this class depends on what section you are in. My topic was \"Myths of love and sex\" and it was so interesting. One of the best classes I've ever taken. Megan is an amazing prof, she really cares about her students. Not too hard, If you put some effort into this class you'll do great. You have to write a research paper, media analysis, blog post and do a final presentation. But all assignments are on the same topic that you choose at the beginning. Also there is a group project but you do it in class and it's easy",
      "It's a little biased because if you are already a good writer it's very easy, but there are good opportunities to fix mistakes that you don't realize you're making. How Should We Be Working (or something like that) is a great section to take, even though I just picked it for the time slot. Isn't so much as content heavy as it uses the content to make examples.",
      "Prof was excellent!\nI like psychology so this was relatively fun, but it really wasted a big chunk of my school time to get there in the evening and sit through the lectures. (I LOVE online classes)\nThe prof really explained things well, he was approachable, understanding, and kind.  He extended due dates and was very accomodating, which helped so many of us.\nRichard Ebach is his name (may have spelled it wrong, sorry!)\n\n\nDownside: group work. does it ever end well? eh, unavoidable anyway.\nI don't think I'd ever use this in my future career though, but who knows.",
      "The class is okay but the workload is absolutely insane! I have more assignments in this class than several others. Every week we have to write on a discussion board, or we have to write an essay, or we have to peer-review other people's essays in addition to other assignments the prof gives us. It is nearly impossible to keep up with. And, the professor seems to have high standards so it is really difficult to get a decent grade. ",
      "Had to take this course to fulfill the arts requirements, definitely recommend taking a topic that you're interested in otherwise this class can be extremely boring",
      "This course had pretty complicated concepts but the marking ends up being fairly chill. TONS of group work. ",
      "Super easy if you like writing.",
      "I took \"How to win a tarde war\". Was a great class, really helped me understand the academic world and how knowledge is actually created. There is a lot of writing and the final project is a paper worth 50% of the grade which you write over the 4 months.",
      "SCIENCE OF HAPPINESS (online)\nIt was a good course, the subject was obviously only on happiness and what causes it and so on. Reflection papers every week, and a presentation and report at the end of the term. Some readings and videos to watch each week and then discussion posts obviously. ",
      "HIGHLY RECOMMEND Prof. Zaman and \"Food and Diasporas\". \nPretty easy course with a light workload, but still quite interesting and you get to read and write about yummy food. Prof is super duper understanding and caring, one of the only professors I've seen who actually sets up separate time slots for international students + offers extensions readily if you're having trouble. ",

      "I took Arts140: Solving the climate crisis and i loved it. we mostly had discussions as a class or breakout groups and discussed readings she assigned to us. The class is mostly writing and demonstrating your opinion on the climate crisis. ",
      "We learned Chicago citations in this course, but I haven't used it since. Marking style was relatively easy up until the final paper for some reason. Since this course is mandatory for Arts students, I'd recommend finding a topic that seems fun and enrolling in it early. Images at Work was okay if you like paintings. ",
      "Avoid Barb Bloemhof at all costs. The actual content is very dry and if you paid at least a little attention in english in grade 12 you won't learn anything new.",
      "I took this course with Prof. Manji and the course deliverables were divided up in a very fair manner and spaced out so that you have time to do everything in steps instead of just one major assignment at the end. ",
      "I took 'Monuments, Now!' with Joan Coutu and it was the easiest and interesting course. You get to choose 4 out of 5 discussion posts which are pretty easy and an overall group assignment to create a monument, which if you are passionate about the topic, it is extremely useful and easy. Prof Coutu is a great and kind professor. ",
      "I took Arts 140 Science of Happiness, it was my third choice but it was worth it. I ended up loving the professor and course, it is easy to keep up with as well. Make sure you engage as much as possible and thrive to improve!!",
      "Personally, I learned a lot about literature reviews and citations. This class really made you attentive in what you were adding in your assignment and the course content was extremely managable",
      "From what I've been hearing, your prof really matters with your ARTS 130/140 course. I had Dr. Deman and he made it so worth it. The subject wasn't one that I was particularly interested in, but he made it interesting. The workload is very light, especially in the beginning. Towards the end, we had to write a Term Paper and a short video which was the most amount of work we had to do. It wasn't particularly useful, but the ARTS 130/140 courses are meant to be more transition courses.",
      "Really helps you develop your writing skills. Keep up and do your best and you will be fine. Professor marks based on progress more than skill. ",
      "Best course. I played Undertale and wrote a paper on it. Also BEST PROF!!! 1 group, 1 oral individual, and at the end you made your own game! Also, like 3 papers. No final!!! ",
      "There were a lot of weekly activities, discussions, etc. that sometimes took away study time for other classes. If you are taking this online and have other priorities it can be hard to manage at times. The pod group system for discussions can be frustrating if you are the only one posting anything, as feedback from peers is a large part of this course.",
      "If you like and/or are good at writing you will probably find this pretty easy. The essay writing was kind of a pain but in the grand scheme of things it really wasn't a huge amount of work. Most classes just consisted of group discussions about something that 80% of the class didn't read or that they skimmed in 5 minutes before the class. ",
      "Arts140 could potentially be extremely useful, however, because of its small class sizes; however, because of its small class sizes, scarcity and lack of resource management manifests itself. In my experience, the professor was not exactly suited for teaching. Do not spend too much effort on this course, and allocate time for your prospective major, minor etc. ",
      "Prof was very sweet and taught well, but the content wasn't exactly engaging or helpful in any way. ",
      "The Science of Happiness was a nice change of pace. The lectures and course work aren't too heavy or demanding. You learn a lot of helpful tricks to manage your own happiness and for the most part the course work is easy. Also the format of the assignments are all different, so it's not just essays and you get to experiment with different writing styles. There's weekly participation posts but they don't require much engagement and the professor doesn't schedule exercises for the same week as assignments. Very manageable workload, lots of helpful feedback, and interesting information.",
      "Arts and the 4th Industrial Revolution with Mr.Lochner. Mr.Lochner is awesome.",
      "I took the Disney section of ARTS 140. If you grew up a Disney kid, want a relatively easy course with a fun professor, I highly suggest this class. This was the only class I looked forward to during my week and Joe is a really funny, sarcastic and nice guy. Not only that but the content is pretty interesting. Joe really knows his stuff and I enjoyed learning about Disney's history. The class consists of lectures where we discuss history, meaning behind the lands in Disney, and how good Disney is at attracting visitors. With all this, you have to write a few papers and a presentation where you create your own land in Disney. ",
      "it was okay, but I feel like I didn't really learn anything lol",
      "This was a fun class that was a nice change. It allowed me to learn about things that I would otherwise never put the time into researching. Interesting to learn about business practices and engineering advances by Disney, something I was not aware of previous to this course. It was refreshing and fun, Joe was a great prof that made the class super fun!",
      "Homelessness and Addiction- Done in an ethnographic anthropology style, we studied and read a few ethnographies. The workload was pretty big, a two page reading paper on the reading, a one page peer review on a student's presentation, about ~4 hours of readings a week, and one presentation. However, the information was super good to learn about and the discussions were interesting and engaging. ",
      "My professor made this course not the greatest. His questions were often too complex to have meaningful questions to. His own privilege often stopped him from understanding students' answers and diverse experiences. It could have been a good course if the professor had better communication skills. ",
      "Completely useless online. We learned nothing, the actual content didn't properly match the course description, and there were so many writing assignments that were meant to help teach us university level writing but there weren't any instructions or help about anything involving the writing process! We had to deal with all of this, and the prof still decided to be a hard marker. The ARTS first courses are marketed as a part of the arts program as these helpful courses, but they do the opposite and made me question even choosing this school. Get rid of them and let first year arts students take actual useful courses they'd like!",

      "I would not reccomend this course (enviroemental bioethics). The description does not align with the content taught, it is all based on books and not really applicable to the real world. My professor, Thomas Milovac was not very enganging and appeared to be annoyed on many occasions when no one had an answer to his questions, without considering his faluries to engage the class. He is a picky marker aswell. I do believe he has potential to be better, but must work on his teaching methods and attitude. ",
      "Prof made the class insanely boring. I don't know why my arts 140 class was the hardest of all of my classes. My prof was Thomas Milovac. Environmental Bio Ethics was the course",
      "Class is organized very well and if you follow the way that it is set out you will be able to keep up. Takes a bit of time as there is a final research paper, an annotated bibliography, and a final presentation, but overall an easy course to keep up with. "

I should not have to go out of my way to ask what I could improve on an assignment that I hand in.",
      "Easy course, just annoying and tedious workloads. Good to brush up on Grammer and Communications skills necessary for interveiws and co ops. But again, the workload, weekly assignments and lenghty readings were very annoying and not useful. The prof was pretty funny at times and helpful though.",
      "As a course overall, it's basically English class but at University Level and focused on Engineering. You have to read about engineering topics and make reports and essays. You learn about IEEE citations and you have to speak in front of the class and make a presentation. If you liked English class, you will like this class. Otherwise, it will probably just be boring and a little tedious. But it's not too difficult."

      "Let me begin by explaining that I'm the kind of student that puts their head down and grinds when it matters, but isn't afraid to take time to have fun and keep a balance between life and school. This class destroyed that balance. I spent countless hours every week trying to understand everything, and truthfully quite a but of it I understood after working towards it. I was never terrible at math, but there were those units that I definitely found harder than others. I didn't use the textbook past the midterm because my prof's notes stopped paralleling the content which made it difficult to teach myself- because yes you need to do that this whole course. Keith KILLED ME - I tried so hard being respectful in my emails but he almost broke me. So here's the thing about him... he gives good notes that he posts about the lessons and STUDY THOSE if you can. Those are what he bases exams and quizzes after. BUT - he also encourages students to work through problems on their own first to try and understand the material, which yes seems like a good idea, but he also has a policy of refusing to help students with questions when his quizzes are open - BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A QUIZ OPEN AND AVAILABLE - so this man NEVER answers questions which is extremely wrong because we as students are paying for him TO TEACH and how do we learn if he doesn't help?? 10/10 Recommend investing in chegg over the textbook for this course and don't be shy from Quizlet - trust me when I say it's a much better investment. For the midterm a tip is to throw multiple choice questions from past quizzes into a doc so you can just use ctrl+f or command-f to search through questions. If you work your butt off you'll get through, but MAKE STUDY GROUPS - step away from your social anxiety and just do it cause dude everyone is suffering in this class, but asking questions between one another will be a life saver. Exams are usually 15 M/C marks and 70 marks or so in problems. ",

      "I took this course in 2019 when the topic was the Future of Nature. The Jarislowsky Fellows for our class were photographer and Anthropocene-producer Edward Burtynsky, and historian and writer Mike Davis. It was a treat to hear these experts speak at length about the development of their careers and interests in a more intimate, less polished environment. When lockdowns began to shutter activity in March 2019, Professor Davis made prescient predictions about the stress on longterm care, the health sector, and service industry and manufacturing workers. \n\nARTS 490 was project-based and graded on a pass-fail basis. I encourage anyone to make space for this course. It is not only personally rewarding and challenging; it's a great resume addition due to the ability to make connections across many disciplines and industries.",
      "This course is incredible. The guest lectures by global experts in the topic are extraordinarily interesting, with some really significant figureheads involved. There's one big project and a few mini assignments, and no tests so you can really focus on paying attention to the lectures without taking notes. I believe the structure of this course is the future of exceptional education."

      "The perfect beginner ASL course. The class environment is nice since it's quiet the whole time (except during our break in the middle). Took this course with Georgia Whalen (who is deaf, so she's an ASL native). The course content is presented at a good pace and she provides a lot of time to practice during class. Had a few quizzes where Georgia would sign something and we would have to write down what it meant. Kind of like a spelling test. Had a research paper where we wrote about ASL, some homework assignments (usually summarizing something from the reading or an activity from the textbook), self-assessments (you just fill out a scale), a final video where you tell a story in ASL, and a final dialogue where you're partnered up with somebody from the class and you basically review everything you've learned in the format of a dialogue. In my opinion, this was the hardest because you had to memorize the order of the whole dialogue and what to say because it was kind of long (maybe about 7 minutes of dialogue).",
      "Incredibly important class to take, no wonder the wait list is always so long. Amazing and caring prof. Lectures are usually only 2 - 2.5 hours and you get breaks between. Learn lots about Deaf culture and communicating with the Deaf community. You are bound to succeed in this class. Just make sure to attend each lecture as it is the only way you can learn things.",
      "Easy course, prof marks and replies slow. If you go to class you will do well. Workload wise it has two easy quizzes, an essay that is difficult to find sources for, a partner recorded dialogue and then the final project is a story-telling recording. You can't wear a mask in this course.",
      "I would highly, highly recommend that you learn at least the alphabet (and how to sign your name) in ASL before you start the class. If you are willing to learn a few basic signs before you start, that may also be helpful. I tried to learn ASL by myself but couldn't get very far but having those basic skills and knowledge about what certain signs mean was so incredibly helpful and allowed me to do better in the class than I think I would have otherwise. The content of the course is mostly just introductory information; learning signs and basic phrases so that you can have a very basic conversation with someone and tell a narrative story. Be prepared to be constantly practicing in class. Please note: Don't use your voice in class, it's disrespectful to the prof and ultimately will help your learning :)",
      "Super easy and cool language",
      "One of the best courses i've taken at UW. Georgia is a great professor who cares about the success of her students. Even in the online delivery format, you can learn so much if you put in the effort",
      "This class is an easy 100%. It's very useful and everyone should learn ASL. Georgia is very easy on her marking and looks for effort rather than accuracy. As long as you do your homework, show up to class and make an effort on assignments you'll get amazing grades!"

It is a process that starts with a search for \"big ideas\" using tools such as research, observation, and appreciative inquiry. Next, entrepreneurs analyze situations and apply creativity techniques to develop solutions. Finally, solutions are tested against business drivers including customer value propositions, customer identification, channel selection, and resource needs. This course covers the three steps that form the foundation of all entrepreneurial success: big ideas, solutions, and testing.

      "Assignments were extremely unclear and marking lacked any form of generosity. The content was alright, but the assignments ruined it. They were FAR more effort than a 100 level course should have.",
      "Useless course, with a completely arbitrary marking scheme.",
      "Might be the most empty and worthless course I've taken to date. No content, just a ton of time consuming assignments that teach you how to bullshit. I didn't realise UW offered the intellectual equivalent of a college level high school English course. 100% subjective and the marks guaranteed to depend on your marker. ",
      "Extremely tedious assignments of very little value.\nWould not recommend.\nTake ECON220 instead if you're considering the Entrepreneurship option.",

      "I only took this course because I couldn't get into the one I wanted. There was a noticeable lack of effort put into this course. Most of the content is borrowed from online. Assignment instructions were unorganized and incredibly vague. There's not a lot of practice related to the coursework. I was expecting more out of this but it felt like a high school class. ",
      "Contrary to the past reviews, I actually found this course to be the easiest course I've taken to date. I believe they must've changed the course to make it easier, because the entire course was just 5 assignments, each on average around 500 words, and could be written up in no more than 1 hour.  Didn't really learn much, apart from having to brainstorm some potentially cool startup ideas. But if you're just looking for an ez bird course, this is the holy grail. ",
      "Very insightful as an introductory course to entrepreneurship! Quite easy, took about 3 hours to get most of the assignments done. The last assignment was really the only one that took more time. If you are really interested in entrepreneurship, the assignments are a blast to do, and you will actually enjoy the process of researching, designing and creating a solution for various real world problems. However, I would advise against leaving the assignments till the last minute since you can, of course, do them in just a few hours, but you will likely miss the researching and learning opportunity from just going on a random search spree with your chosen problem. It totally helped me find a strategy to solve my chosen problem that was quite unique.",

Some of them mark based on their own preferences, rather than follow the mark scheme. This was made very clear by the comments they wrote on students' assignments. So, this can make or break your experience. ",

      "The course is very easy. You can start the assignments ~20 minutes before the DD and submit to get an easy 70-80. However, the content was very dry. I took BET320 prior to BET100 so perhaps this skewed my view because there is overlapping content, but, I would recommend BET320 over BET100 if you're actually interested in learning.",

Wallahi most useless class, most bs class, most shit class, I can even describe how shit it is. and the TA is straight ass too like they didn't change my grade once, its the same damn grade for every assignment. useless and boring. easy your get marks tho if you just submit some random bs every 2 weeks.

      "It was fun, but the material and questions were way beyond what you would expect for a course that's numbered 110",
      "This course was not easy! There's a lot of terminology and a lot to memorize.  I had Marcel Pinheiro as my prof, he was really enthusiastic and engaging.  We had clicker quizzes every class which counted towards our marks, so we had to read our textbooks in advance. The labs were really fun and easy, you get to dissect all kinds of species. The lab exam though, was SO hard! There was a slideshow  with arrows pointing things that were indistguishable and you had to fill in the blank. Exams are a bit tricky too. Helps with Biol 165 though! ",
      "If you're an engineer looking for an NSE, would not recommend this course. Had a lot of fun doing the dissection labs, but the other half are microscope ones and they're really boring and tedious. The exam requires massive amounts of memorization, and for sure you won't be using 99% of what you learned again.",
      "Content was interesting but really difficult. If you are thinking of taking this course make sure you are able to devote a lot of time into it.",
      "The class is pure memorization, it is not something you can cramp for. The lab component is super fun, be sure to review everything front and back in the lab manual for the quiz! And look at the stuff they have on the side benches, they can be in the lab final ",
      "I found the subject material really interesting and the lab component was also pretty fun, once we got past the drawings part. Memorization is definitely made easier with graphic organizers.",
      "Difficult course with A LOT of memorization. Lab dissections were fun but you really have to know your stuff. ",
      "Lab with oral quizzes and the lab exam is hard. The format is to identify structures shown in the photos.\nLots of memorization. Bad drawings in course note.",
      "Pretty easy course if you are good at memorizing. Textbook isn't needed. If you memorize the lab manual and his slides you are set. Easy peasy 90+. ",
      "easiest bio take it for sure",
      "Pretty much just straight memorizing. Never once opened the textbook, everything was from the lectures. If you memorize the lectures you'll be fine. The lab actually helped a lot, allowing you to visualize the organisms you are discussing. ",
      "A fairly dry class requiring a lot of memorization. ",
      "This course is purely memorization. Do whatever you can do cram that information into your head.\n\nAlso, you need to go to lectures.\n\nThe only thing that makes up for the dry content is the few quarkey things that you learn about animals that you can show off to your friends (Like telling them how different animals have sex...).",
      "So. Much. Memorization in the Labs. They really help visualize what you're learning though. ",
      "Such a fun course to take but it gets pretty hard! Pinherio is very engaging as a prof and makes this topic less of pain to learn about. The course goes into a lot of detail of the life cycles of different organisms and their specific characteristics. Lots of scientific names that are hard to remember too! I suggest making cue cards with the different phyla names on them  so you can practice them throughout the term (they're key to knowing what midterm and exam questions are talking about).  The exam wasn't too bad if you studied hard for it. The lab component of the course was super useful and gave you hand on experience with some of the animals that you talk about in lecture. I recommend reading through lecture slides and the lab manual before going into the lab since there are lab quizzes after every dissection. The lab exam is extremely difficult so start studying early. It's a powerpoint presentation where they show you a pictures of organisms that you looked at in the lab with arrows pointing to something (often to what seems like nothing) and they ask 2-4 simple questions on it (like \"what is this structure\", \"what phyla is this from\" etc). This is also very helpful if you take BIOL 165!",
      "Not my favorite course. Lab was brutal. 80+ in the course. Lab component is important to do well. My TA was an asshole for the lab. Lecture is wonderful, enjoyed learning phylums. ",

      "For this class, textbook is not required since all questions tested on the midterms and final exam was off of lecture slides, and Labs. This course is content heavy but is very interesting. There were three writing assignments, of which at the end of the term based on peer review, you pick one for final marking. This course has one midterm, a lab and final exam, and clicker questions for participation. IN ODER TO pass this course, you have to pass the lab component, but is quite easy to do so. Make sure you do your best in the labs as that is where most of you marks come from. ",
      "I am a first year biology student who took this course in Fall of 2019 with Marcel Pinheiro. I thought it was a great class which was taught well. The content can be a bit dry (depending on where your interests lie) but Marcel always made the lectures fun and engaging. A lot of the information covered was new, not much was review from high school. The content was relatively easy to understand, but there is a lot of memorization: especially of comparison between different species studied. The midterm and exam were both fair. The textbook is not essential but can be a great help for understanding certain concepts, my professor also did assign readings from it for each chapter. Involved in this course there is also an essential laboratory component. It consisted of 5 labs using microscopes and drawing slides (which was very tedious) and 5 dissections. The lab was great to get a lot of hands on experience using lab equipment. Overall it was an enjoyable course and not too difficult!",
      "Pinherio is the best prof youll ever have. The course is hard and takes a lot of memorization, but I definitely think that the lab is what makes it so much fun. We had these amazing TAs Laura and Mitch, and they hands down were the stars of this course. If you ever get a chance to meet them in your biology career have a chat with them, theyre the sweetest TAs ive met! You'll definitely enjoy the lab",
      "Lots of content but very interesting and fun. There were three writing assignments, all of which you get feedback, and submit one for final marking, one midterm, exam, and clicker questions for participation. Textbook not required as content was tested in what was covered in class. Lab every week and the lab exam was a killer.",
      "Coming from a first-year biology student! This course has been fairly straightforward and involves a lot of memorization. Personally, I didn't find this course that interesting but Pinheiro has made it fairly enjoyable. It is easy to do well in this class- the mark breakdown involved 15% group work, which was probably the only time I was sociable this year and not bad at all. The marks coming from this part of the course are usually from coming up with just one multiple-choice question based on the previous week's content (an easy 15%!). 10% comes from completing the textbook questions, in which the weight would be moved to the midterm and final exam if you don't purchase. 30% came from the lab - online, this was an easy 30% as well lol. The remaining marks come from the 15% midterm and 30% final, both of which include fair questions, as long as you have good notes. I think the biggest mistake students in this course can make is having poor/no notes. Otherwise, you can expect good results! ",
      "Loveddddd this course! Pinheiro is a gem and the content was so interesting. If this course isn't a req for you, take it anyway! ",
      "Group work was actually ok (i normally hate group work). It was very clear what was expected of us and the course followed what was outlined at the beginning very well. the content was enjoyable and interesting. The tests were fair and fairly easy given that they were open book, but i bet all the information would have made in-person, closed-book tests challenging.",
      "Completely easy and super fun! He made his lectures so engaging and had so much life in his voice. To fully understand the content and do well on the midterm and final exam, I'd say you have to watch his lectures because he does explain things thoroughly. Midterm and final exam were completely based on content he went over and the questions were very direct. They were probably some of the easiest exams I had ever written. Overall, loved the course!",
      "I took this class online in Winter '21. The structure is very similar to that of BIOL 165, but overall, I found it more interesting. BIOL 110 focused more on animals rather than random content on pinecones or trees from 165. Not a heavy class, did not require a textbook, and comes with a lab component that I found pretty fun as well. Lectures are just like 165, Marcel teaching you passionately with a lot of enthusiasm. Midterms and exams were open-book and multiple choice. Just like 165, there is a BASS component where you work with a group throughout the term to produce one MCQ per week or so, very easy. In regards to the lab, there are a few assignments, one where you had to draw and label, which I loved. A few other \"assignments\" were quizzes where you were given pictures of different parts of animals focused on their anatomy, like the adductor muscle of a clam, and had to fill in the blank as to what the part was called. Lastly, can't forget about the fish dissection! Most students were required to purchase a fish and follow instructions on how to dissect it, take photos, and label it. If you're vegetarian or have a fish allergy, they compensated for this and provided you with photos to label. Overall, great and fun class!",
      "It is not easy but Dr. Pinheiro is so engaging and compassionate. The content is really cool! The lab is the best part because you get to look at animals like starfish and crayfish! Super cool course",
      "A lot of interesting content and memorization (in the end everything turns into mush in your brain). Prof is very engaging and makes lectures fun. Labs are very helpful, but make sure you prepare well for those (I was watching direction videos on YouTube the right before). Tests are fair, with no trick questions. ",
      "Took this course in Fall 2022. The mark breakdown is 35% cumulative final exam, 20% midterm, 15% quizzes (best 5 out of 6, 2 attempts each), and 30% lab (18% lab drawings and quizzes + 12% lab bell ringer final). Lecture videos are updated so it is possible to do well in this course without attending in-person classes. The quizzes are a mark booster and very good practice for the midterm and final. The midterm and final are not very challenging. The hardest part of this course is the lab component. Drawings and dissections are not very hard. The lab final will definitely bring your mark down as the class average was 59.5%. Finished this course with a low 90,  which was less than my mark in BIOL 165 taken also with Dr. Pinherio. No textbook is required for this course.",

The Lab Participation and Reading Assignments (similar to the smartbook bonus in BIOL 239) are both free marks. The Lab Assignments have questions that are not worded properly so asking your TA what the question is asking you is important to do good. The Lab Report is not hard itself as I got a 90+. The term tests are based on both lecture and lab material. The term tests include a Part A (10%) with MC and T/F questions as well as a Part B (10%) with only Long Answer questions.

The first couple of lectures were review of high school but after that it was new stuff. The course consisted of weekly quizzes, two midterms, and a final. The weekly quizzes had no time limit, so I would peruse the lectures and Google to make sure that I answered the questions correctly. The midterms and the exam were all multiple choice, so that was nice. The first midterm is easier than the second, for the reason I mentioned before, namely, the second is on new material. The exam was the one of the more enjoyable exams I've written thus far. I finished with 45 minutes to spare and I was one of the later ones to leave the gym. I even chuckled during the exam. This was also from cramming the whole night before the exam. BIOL 130 was an excellent and easy course.",
      "This course is extremely content heavy! The lecture slides lack a significant amount of material, therefore, it is crucial that you attend lectures and take notes. The profs speak very quickly, so note taking is a skill that improves with practice. I would highly suggest reading the text book, the lectures slides include hundreds of different diagrams, however, none of the diagrams are explained, so the book is very helpful. The first mid-term was fairly easy, the second was also fair, however, the final exam was extremely challening. The questions were very specific and the answer choices were not always clear. This course is certainly useful and very interesting, however, there is alot of work due to the combination of the lecture and tutorial. ",
      "Textbook wasn't needed, just attend lectures and take notes :) Things move fast so stay alert in class!",
      "This course is just a course that almost all science students have to take to put everyone on the same playing field. It's a bit tricky if you didn't take bio in high school but as long as you keep up with the studying and go to lecture you should be fine. The tutorial is pretty pointless but its easy marks and it isn't every week which is nice. Midterms and exams are long (all around 110 M/C questions) but they're mostly pretty fair.. It's a very helpful course once you get into the upper year cell bio courses. ",
      "fun course! With bio comes work, but the profs are super funny and nice ",
      "Lots of memorization, but also expands on highschool knowledge rapidly. It is interesting but the first midterms screws a lot of people.",
      "A decent amount of the content was grade 12 bio review, the rest was just expanding on it. The midterms were ok and yes there was a lot to memorize but it was not hard.",
      "A lot of content! Most of it is review from grade 12 biology but review your stuff and make sure you study to UNDERSTAND as compared to studying to memorize. The professors are useless. They are not willing to help you and are salty when you try to ask them questions. Midterms are pretty easy but the final was challenging. It's definitely not an easy course but its not impossible.

      "I found Dr Holyoak very difficult for my learning style - he spoke incredibly fast & never seemed to repeat anything - so if you missed it it was gone.",
      "Fairly easy to do well in if you put an hour per week of effort into staying on track with the powerpoints and occasionally reading bits of the textbook. Some review from grade 12, but still an interesting and informative course.",
      "useless class with a stupid policy of 50% on the final to get a pass on the course! Another is useless tutorial time!",
      "Mostly review for highschool with some extra detail later in the course. I enjoy Bio so this was interesting course (most of the time.) Holyoak and Engelhardt are very passionate and are really great, engaging professors, so they make the course al lot more tolerable! As long as you study hard and seek clarification when needed, good marks guaranteed!\n",
      "Course was just a continuation of high school biology. If you go to class or review the textbook sections, it's very easy to do well on the unit quizzes and the midterms. The final is tricky so do not leave studying until last minute. This is not a class you want to slack in. If you put a little effort in to do well, the course is simple. ",
      "The course was mostly review from grade 12 biology. It had unnecessary tutorials that were mandatory. Fair midterms, clickers for participation  and unit quizzes. Exam was okay, ~10 questions per unit. Textbook not mandatory.",
      "Challenging.",
      "proffs go extremely fast, but are very funny people. exam policy was really dumb, 50% in exam to pass the course when the exam was worth 40% of the final. so if you had 100% in course before exam and get a 49% in exam, you would basically fail the course. try to understand concepts more than memorize, tough to learn everything before exam.

      "It is so dry and boring, so difficult not to fall asleep in class, and paying attention is so difficult. Less then half of the class showed up by the end of the semester. The textbook and YouTube should be your best friends for this course. ",

      "Not very difficult to do well in the course. The tutorials are worthless. Made us look some journal articles, when I've already had experience with reading journal articles. Ended with an 80+ because I screwed up the tutorials by forgetting citations and such. :(",

      "The first two thirds tears through mostly high school review, last third is mostly new. Holyoak's midterm (the first) was very fair. Engelhardt's midterm (the second) was challenging but also fair. Her exam was another story. \"A, B, C, A & B, A & C, B & C, all of the above, none of the above, etc.\" I finished the exam with about half an hour of time left, but this really didn't help much since the questions were so confusing and specific. Get good marks on the midterms, because the exam will lower it.  ",
      "first few weeks is all review. after the first midterm you start learning new content at a pretty fast pace and it's easy to fall behind. the midterms are pretty doable if you can answer the clicker questions",
      "A lot of the course was grade 12 review, with a little more extra stuff thrown in at the end. The first 1/2 was taught by Dr. Holyoak, and the other 1/2 was taught by Dr. Engelhardt. Both did a pretty good job of explaining the content. Dr. Holyoak recorded his lectures, which was a blessing.  Dr. Engelhardt didn't, and I wish she did because she spoke very quickly at times. She also has a different style of teaching that takes a little getting used to. (a lot of metaphors and comparisons, lol) There were 2 midterms and the final, the questions were tricky, and you will get SO SICK of answers like \"A, B, A & B, None of the above\" that will cause you to question your sanity. Make sure you know the content, but don't second guess yourself too much either! There quite a few diagrams in the lecture notes, and sometimes they can be hard to understand if there's no description provided, and the prof goes over it too quickly. A good idea would be to look at the caption for the diagram in the textbook. This course requires quite a bit of memorization, but it's not impossible to get a good mark with hard work. I agree with the person below who said try to do good on the midterms. ",
      "midterms are tough, study lots, it was an enjoyable course if you are interested in biology, but many questions on midterms are minor things, such as whether things moved from cytosol out, or if it was other way around, so make sure you know your stuff!",
      "Many contents for me, fundamentals are required by upper year classes",
      "Hard class, lots of detail but some of it was interesting. Dr Holyoak went through lectures crazy fast, but he covered everything that would be tested, unlike Dr Engelhardt. Midterms werent too bad but the exam was brutal. ",

      "This is a difficult course with lots to memorize. If you aren't willing to put some serious work in, do not take this course. Textbook isn't needed, but you need to go to lecture and take good notes. Although this course was difficult, I found it very interesting and useful for future courses. ",
      "Memorization is one thing you have to be good at if you want to take this course and do well. If you aren't willing to put some serious work in, do not take this course. If you want to save yourself some money and not buy the textbook, it is a must you go to class and take efficient notes as the exam and midterms are from IN CLASS content only. The first midterm is much easier than the 2nd one as it based mainly on high school review AND is written by Dr Holyoak but does not mean that no effort is needed.  Although this course was difficult, the content taught in this class was indeed interesting. \n\n\nDISCLAIMER: \n In order to pass this course, you must pass one midterm and the final to pass the course, if you fail both midterms then they make you drop the course. If you fail your final exam, then a mark of 45% is given on your transcript. \n",
      "A pretty easy course since it was mostly high school review. All the assessments were MC. ",
      "Seems pr easy at first but only up til the first midterm. After that, it's all downhill from there. Especially since Engelhardt speeds through like 100 slides in one class, I never felt like I was actually learning anything during lectures :(",
      "Easy course for a non-science student if you want it as an elective",
      "This course was basically straight from grade 12 but with a bunch more information. Midterms are soft but the exam was a little bit gross. You have to think about the questions and all the all of the above or only a and c make you insane.",
      "I am a first year biology student who took this course in Fall 2019 with Todd Holyoak and Heidi Engelhardt. I truly enjoyed this course, as it covered some of the topics that I am interested in pursuing. The content was always very interesting (in my opinion) and was usually easy - although there were some challenging concepts. There was a decent amount of overlap from high school biology, mostly grade 12. While the textbook isn't essential, I would highly recommend it as I personally used it a lot. In lectures sometimes concepts are not fully explained, which can result in a lot of confusion. I found that the textbook (I bought the 4th edition used) followed the course almost directly and was very helpful when rewriting / going through notes. The midterms were both fair, as well as the online quizzes. The final exam was tough but if you understand the concepts well you will do just fine. There is a lot of information in this course, so be sure to give yourself a lot of time to prepare for tests.",
      "Took this course as an elective and I really enjoyed it. I didn't really have much science background from high school either but they taught the course really well and there is very little-if anything-you need to clarify beyond the lecture notes. That being said, make sure to take good lecture notes because the words on the slides alone are not enough to easily build a good understanding, at least for me. If you review well before exams and attend class 90 is very doable.",
      "Don't make your life harder that it has to be, don't make my mistake and take this course as elective..",
      "Not very practical for all students",
      "BIOL 130 was not an easy course, but the information that you learn will come back in other courses. I wouldn't recommend buying the textbook as we were usually only tested on the things discussed in lecture. If you study hard and pay attention to the diagrams in the notes, it's very possible to get a 90 or higher.",
      "It's the basics of cell biology, very useful. I wouldn't say it's that easy though, only because there is so much content to know. But a lot of it should be from high school so it's not that bad.",
      "Tough course, but necessary for science students. You learn a lot of the small details that are necessary background information for future biology courses at UW. ",
      "I died",
      "Much more clear and interesting when not taught by Heidi Engelhardt. She spoke too fast and used complicated words that were not even legible. her slides had no words and if you were unable to hear a word she said in class (which was fairly common with the way she spoke) you would not understand what was even going on in the course. She taught the first half of the course, which is the basic information you need to understand to be able to understand the second half. GOOD luck to anyone taking this course when shes teaching.",
      "I took this course online fall 2020 with Holyoak and Engelhardt. \n\nUnlike most reviews here, I found Engelhardt to be better than Holyoak; she actually put effort into her slides and made new lecture videos. Holyoak, on the other hand, used lecture recordings from previous years (no pointer tools on powerpoint were used, and hence made it hard to follow along with diagrams). Both of their slides have primarily images: to do well, you HAVE to listen to the lectures, especially if you do not want to buy the textbook.\n\nPersonally, the textbook was useful for me. The profs referred to specific figure numbers (images) in the textbook, and hence reading the captions under those images in the textbook were useful when re-writing summary notes for each unit. Do worksheets posted on LEARN before tests, as well as practice problems at the end of the textbook chapters.\n\nGood luck!",
      "I really hated this course, but its a prerequisite for a bunch of future BIOL courses so it's recommended that you take it. the tests are very very application-based so the way you studied bio in high school (what i did was memorizing a bunch of keywords and just going into the test) probably won't work in this course. I had dr engelhardt and dr holyoak, but to be honest i didn't feel like either one of them could explain the content well. maybe my experience would have been different had i been on campus but for this course i would recommend u take things into your own hands and just teach yourself all the material through mindmaps, quizzing yourself and reading the textbook. ",
      "Interesting course, you can learn well if you try. Test questions are very tricky though.\nTips for studying: Make good notes, make unit summary sheets, use active recall, re-do mTuners, look at old test mistakes and ask yourself why it was wrong (asking a friend is a good idea), sleep enough before the tests lol, and call friends for study sessions.\n\nThe exam was a doozy tbh. Content very different from the course (except for unit 8)",
      "(Learned remotely due to COVID) All tests/ exams were multiple-choice. You would think that's easy right? Sometimes it was... But most of the time the questions involved 3 options and the other options were \"A and C\" and \"A, B, C.\" Professor Engalheardt really knows how to make a multiple-choice question feel like a short answer question because you will need to explain the question to yourself thoroughly in order to arrive at the answer. Half of this course was grade 12 bio and the other half was an expansion of grade 12, adding more detail to the concepts taught in high school. Make sure you are able to explain each concept in the required amount of detail by yourself WITHOUT the aid of notes or textbooks. In other words, don't scroll through your notes or text and convince yourself you know the material. You only truly know the concepts if you can explain them to yourself. If you understand this, you can get a 90% no problem.",
      "intro to bio course like high school but more. go to every class for clickers even if its 8am just wake up it really helps for exams",
      "[Coming from a student who had taken this course online during COVID-19]\n\nSimilar structure to what you would expect of a biology high school course. Every unit has a set of lectures, a few mTuners that acted as graded active recall quizzes, and then a semi-cumulative test. Core concept assignments definitely helped with my understanding and got me to see if I lacked knowledge somewhere, but with good time management, these were not a bother for me. Grades for these assignments in-part came from your peers as they reviewed you and some can be unfair, but profs built in a system that allowed them to be reviewed and over-rid. I mostly studied for tests the day before and did well. Tests were all multiple-choice, but don\u2019t be fooled, there are many, many trick options such as the \u201ca, b, c\u201d or \u201ca and b\u201d, etc. that are very tempting. Engelhardt\u2019s lectures had a lot of holes so be sure to go over the textbook to help with the tests. Overall, relatively easy course and an easy 80%+ with the work put into it. I also had Holyoak; his lectures and content were great, but none of his material was found on the exam.",
      "Despite that I've heard about this course, this course wasn't too bad! Content heavy and dependent on the prof. For me, the second part of the course, taught by Dr. Engelhardt, required more textbook reading and individual studying. The first, taught by Dr. Holyoak, was very much passive and studying off of the slides. The course content seems not as connected as I would've liked but provides a solid foundation for upper year BIOL courses.",
      "Make sure you understand the concepts as they are taught because the course keeps building on them.",
      "A lot of stuff from grade 12. Pretty easy to follow along but also really easy to fall asleep. Holyoak's teaching is great but his voice is so soothing that I knocked out 90% of the time. Engelhardt was engaging but I had no idea what she was saying half the time. Just read your notes and you'll be fine. ",
      "I loved biology in high school, but hated this course with a passion. Took this course online and the screencasts (lectures) were often posted late, seemed very scattered and all over the place, and the tests were unnecessarily frustrating. I wouldn't recommend taking this course unless you have to. ",
      "It could be an easy course if the prof was better",
      "Took it with Heidi Engelhardt (ONLINE). A very interesting course. I didn't care much for biology in high school but I found this course changed that. Most units are review from high school but just much more in depth. Though I do have to say that I couldn't stand the multiple choice questions that had choices like  \"A) and B)\" or \"A) and C)\" because it would make me doubt myself LOL! Engelhardt can also be hard to get used to but you'll be fine in the end. I do appreciate how passionate she is about biology! FYI: The textbook is helpful but is not absolutely necessary despite it being required.",
      "I took this course online. It was a lot of review from grade 12 biology. Units that were new content weren't too hard to grasp after some review. Grades are based off 4 tests, a quiz for each unit, and four Kritik presentations. At first, you'll find the kritiks irritating, but they actually help you learn a lot. The textbook is absolutely not necessary, even though its \"required\" and comments here say to buy it. If you take notes on what Engelhardt is actually saying in her screencasts, you'll be prepared for the tests and will do fine (notes from the slides alone are not enough as they aren't very detailed). Her multiple choice are a bit tricky, as they try to get you to doubt yourself, ex: \"A, B, C, A and B, A and C, all of the above\". Overall a pretty easy course if you put in the work, but the professor could be a bit better.",
      "Interesting content. the first chunk was review of grade 12 bio but it got better. it was sometimes a little difficult to tell how specific of details we were expected to remember from processes. i found that everything made sense as she explained them but when it came to reviewing for tests, i had more trouble.",
      "This course is difficult, no doubt about it. Having it online made it easier though. Do not try to cram for this, it will not work at all. The good thing is the grading scheme is fair and allows you to mess up once or twice and still come out well. I put in a minimal amount of effort and finished with 85.",
      "The course was alright, passed with a B. There are 4 tests (15%, 20%, 15%, 25%), 4 kritik assignments which are super easy marks (each kritik assignment worth 6%), and there are weekly quizzes (in total, the quizzes are 5% of your overall grade). The tests are the most important part of the course because their worth the most of your grade, some tests I thought were formatted poorly and the wording wasn't the best so it made it kind of confusing. That being said, make sure you go through EVERYTHING so that your prepared for any type of question that could occur on the test. Study hard, focus well, and you'll be able to do well in this class. ",
      "Very easy course imo, really builds on grade 12 biology and the professor is really helpful.",
      "Course content was easy but disconnected. I hate the question type (A, A and B, B and C). The worksheets had no answer key (which completely defeats their purpose) and the Kritik assignments were useless. People where cheating the system by giving really high scores and comments that boost other student's ego. The TAs' quality is very questionable. Got very simple concepts wrong and would search up the answer on the internet and insist that their answer is correct without being able to explain why. Would not recommend this course. ",
      "The course itself was fairly easy, although difficult at times. It really builds on high school knowledge for the most part, but there is new content. It says the textbook is required, but it's only really to build your understanding. I strongly recommend it, as I relied on it completely. I think part of what made the course a little difficult was the professor. Maybe it's because it's online, which is 100% understandable, but a lot of the content could have gone in more depth. I feel like she may have explained things vaguely at times, but then asked for specifics on the term tests. There were also kritiks, which I actually found extremely useful! I got fair markers who provided constructive feedback, which I found helpful. ",
      "This course was so boring and taught so poorly that i literally changed majors and lost all interest in the subject of biology",
      "This course is tedious in terms of detail, but I personally enjoyed it and did well in it (low 80s). I had Jola Gurska as my prof, and I found her to be a great professor. The trick to do well in this course is simply keep up with weekly content and understand when a certain topic will require more effort to understand. ",
      "I absolutely disliked this course. I took it online in Fall 2021 and my prof was just not very engaging. I had such a horrible experience with the quizzes and the midterms but ended up with a 71. Would not recommend this course unless its a requirement :)",
      "online in fall 2021, felt kind of disorganized so it wasn't that easy to follow. Tests were not bad though ",
      "As someone who thinks cell biology is cool as hell this course was really interesting!! It builds really nicely off of high school biology, if you didn't take bio you'll need to put a little more effort into reading and understanding the material but you'll be okay. ",
      "Get the textbook. dont take if you dont need. takes a tremendous amount of time to learn content and to review/study",
      "The beginning of the course is mostly review from high school but after that you gotta start paying more attention since some of the concepts will be new to you. ",
      "Should take it online if you can. Going to class is kind of useless, you should just read the textbook. Extreme levels of material to cover over little time.",
      "the course started off pretty easy, was mostly high school review. I would just say that it is important to keep up with work and pretty much watch all the videos that the prof gives you.",
      "Heidi makes this course awful. You spend about 2 hours a week watching screencasts recorded during covid. There is no need to buy the textbook unless you need further insight into topics discussed in the screencasts. All the content is regurgitated during lectures. The content is interesting but so crammed into one term. There is a lot to memorize for the three tests throughout the term. ",
      "Not so great. Do not go to the in-person lectures if you watched the online videos, there is no new info in class. Also, studying the textbook is the only reliable way to succeed in the course, since the online videos are not good in the first place. When someone says not to show up to class and not to watch the online videos, you know that there is something wrong with this course.",
      "Half of the course is review, the other half of the course is somewhat new (however, if you paid any attention in grade 11/grade 12 bio, it shouldn't be too much of a jump in material).\n\nThe dumbest thing in the course is the peer evaluations though, where it's mostly just people skewing the data just to get the bonus marks and the people who mark honestly get penalized as everyone just gives free 100s.\n\nYou will need to do a lot of studying on your own, lectures do nothing. Just skip the lectures and watch/read on your own.",
      "The course was outlined and executed in a manner that was not helpful for my learning style. You were required to learn the content all before coming to class in videos that were about 2 hours long. I rarely used the textbook, however, a classmate ensured that all the content covered in the videos is in the textbook. With only 1 class a week for review, I felt like I was not able to learn as successfully in this course. The tests were challenging and required lots of studying ahead of time. The Kritik assignments and iClicker assignments were mark-boosting areas.",
      "Worst course ever for my first term. The professor was extremely disengaging and unsupportive throughout the whole term. Super passive-aggressive, especially towards students in the past cohort, as we are pandemic high school students. I would definitely not recommend this course as an elective, but if it is mandatory for you, then I'd recommend doing really well in the Kritiks as they count for 20% of your mark. Also, try to out in effort into the three tests for the course as the exam was super hard. ",
      "This course was taught in a hybrid model for Fall 2022. There were 2 hours of content to watch online before going to a lecture once a week for 80 minutes. The online lectures were from 2020 and while the content was relevant, they were boring to watch. The in-person lectures were a regurgitation of the online lectures. There were chapter quizzes to be completed after every online lecture, they totalled 5% of the total grade. There were 4 (5% each) Kritik's to complete that involved creating a 5-minute PowerPoint presentation and grading others. This is a little time-consuming but you get easily get a 95%. There are 3 in-person tests that are a high-grade value (10%, 20% and 15%). They are relatively difficult, with some questions being on the tests that were not supposed to be. The final exam is weighted low (25%), however, it is difficult like the tests. Dr. Engelardt puts questions with answer options as A, B, C, A&C, and A&B&C; this is what makes it confusing.",
      "I am a bio major, but I was not a fan of how the course was taught. There was a lot of content to cover and it was all independent. We were expected to use videos from the pandemic to learn the content. The first 3-4 chapters is mainly review but the hardest units were definitely the second half.",
      "This is definitely not an easy course. The content itself is interesting, but the way it was taught did not help me learn it as thoroughly as I would have liked. There was a lot of self-learning, and the lectures were more for quick recaps rather than actual learning. Definitely recommend using the textbook throughout the term. Make sure to do the Kritiks because they can really boost your marks. ",
      "The course content is extremely useful for upper-year bio courses, especially human physiology. However, the professor (Heidi) posted all the lectures online and barely taught them during class, as part of her post-COVID remodel. This means that this entire course was independent and you have to learn the lectures yourself. My best tip is to write your notes based on EVERYTHING she says in the videos. Write the entire video transcript down- I don't care. Her slides alone won't cut it. Then make flashcards out of your notes (ANKI, Quizlet) and study from that. Her midterms and exams are largely based on the little things she says during the lecture videos (which she doesn't even explain that well) so you must refer to the textbook or youtube videos for further in-depth explanations. Also, draw out all the important processes in a diagram format. Some of the weekly online quiz questions appeared on the midterms, so memorize that.\n\nThe content itself was interesting but she didn't teach it in an engaging way. Although I do like the fact that we can pause the video, speed it up, etc. This course was pure memorization, but her midterm/exam questions are application based so make sure you actually understand the material.\n\nI finished this course with a 79. I found it somewhat difficult in the beginning but once I realized a study method that worked, I stuck with it. However, the thing about midterms/exams is that you will always second-guess yourself because of her \"all of the above\" multiple-choice options. Don't fall into that trap- it's the reason why I couldn't get a solid 80.",
      "prof singlehandedly killed my interest for bio. learning model was not it (watch ~ 2 h of videos, then in-person lecture where she just reviews it), mcq questions that make u think its this answer but it isnt (esp with a, b, c, a and c, or all above) and prof made it so that there was only a one week period where u can look at ur test's answers to study for the final exam and u cant even write anything until u leave the room which defeats the whole purpose of going there in the first place. 10% test 1 + 20% test 2  + 15% test 3 + 25% final exam + 5% unit quizzes (quizlet has answer bank) + 5% iclicker questions (quizlet has answer bank) + 20% krikit (do all of them for easy mark booster). weightings can be shifted to get the best mark but no curving. recommend to never take this course esp with this prof.",
      "I personally found this course very enjoyable. I feel that the course reinforced my interest in biology. Be prepared to put in work to memorize content, but even when you get the prof's many \"a and b, a and c, all of the above\" types of questions, if you've memorized and understood efficiently, you won't have a problem with her application questions (consider drawing diagrams of important pathways without using notes...if you can explain something to yourself, you're all set in this class). Before entering this course, I was daunted by the professor because of the negative reviews, but I did not find her bad at all, I actually liked her. Slightly passive-aggressive at times I suppose, but that's like many profs. The online format of content was slightly difficult but the professor reinforced all of the concepts in her 80-minute weekly lectures. A lot of my peers had issues with this, but it is what it is...it's the registrar's office that coordinated lecture times anyway, not the professor (considering she only has 80 minutes to highlight an entire unit, she does a good job). I also saw a lot of previous commenters saying that the textbook is absolutely necessary if you want to pass this course: that is not the case at all. Read the relevant chapters if you want to reinforce your knowledge, but literally all of the questions asked on midterms and the final exam were applicable from the content the professor taught, there were no tricks. The professor just expects you to know your content. Also, the weightings of assessments was very reasonable. The weights were as follows for the midterms and the final exam in this order: 10%, 20%, 15%, 25%. So if you do bad in one of them, you're not screwed. And Kritik assignments/iClicker questions were good mark boosters...lots of opportunities to offset a bad mark on one midterm. Finished with a 92% and it was actually the final exam that brought my mark up. Don't go in with pre-conceived notions about the professor or course difficulty. You've got this, don't be daunted! ",
      "Oh, BIOL 130. For starters, I actually found the content quite interesting. But I think that's the only thing that got me through this course. It's pretty much entirely asynchronous, with a weekly in-person \"recap\" lecture. Those lectures were useless. Heidi would just repeat the exact information (sometimes word for word) from the online videos and if you asked for clarification, you'd only rarely get a clear answer. For some reason she also likes to go in depth on topics that have nothing to do with the course content. Do expect borderline attitude in her LEARN posts, Piazza responses and email responses. On our second midterm, she made an mistake on one of the questions and instead of just taking responsibility for it, she told us that it was \"disturbing\" that only two students caught the mistake. That's just Heidi I guess. As for the content, I would go through her videos, taking notes on everything (everything!) she says, then refer to the textbook to fill in the blanks. Expect quite a few blanks. When it comes to studying, I'd regurgitate every single thing from my notes onto a whiteboard (or sheet of paper), making a sort of mind map. I'd draw and redraw the map until the information stuck. I'd write questions for myself based on the content. I'd also draw any relevant diagrams (specifically helpful in the signalling pathways unit). Finished with a 90. Be sure to read all test questions CAREFULLY. Do not let the \"a and c\" or \"a and b\" or \"a b and c\" type questions get the best of you. This is the kind of course where it's better to have too many notes than not enough. On the positive side, there are three midterms, and flexible weighting scheme (i.e. 5% can be shifted from one assessment to another if it helps your grade). The unit quizzes can also boost your mark too. In general, use the textbook when you need help and ask questions on Piazza. It may not be an enjoyable course, but it's entirely doable - you got this <3",
      "The course is really useful and it covers a lot of content. The lectures were redundant because they were literally Prof. Heidi frantically going over 60+ slides in an hour which she already posted recordings for. ",
      "Heidi was the devil's spawn!",
      "Having come from AP biology with really decent marks and a good high school teacher, the course overall wasn't a major struggle to get the mark I did, which I consider fairly decent. However, I don't think it should have required nearly the amount of effort that I put into it JUST to get that. It was ridiculous. Professor was really unhelpful and the course was a mess, it was entirely self directed learning based on 1-2 hour long videos that the professor uploaded onto learn, the lectures were just 'recaps' that weren't helpful but you were basically forced to attend anyways due to clicker participation marks. The unit quizzes were wordy and complicated but got easier once you got the hang of it. The midterms were brutal purely because there was absolutely no way to prepare other than doing the unit quizzes over and over, flashcards, etc, the style of questions were just really tough to prepare for. I wouldn't take this course unless it was required.  ",
      "Probably easy if you took biology in high school. If you didn't, it is definitely challenging.",
      "I dropped this course like three weeks into the semester, so I can't comment much on the content. However, everyone that I know who's taken it have had complaints about.. all of it. It might be because of our professor (Heidi) though. ",
      "The course itself I didn't find too difficult as it's mainly highschool biology review, though I still despise it with a passion and it is all because of the prof. Before we even had our first lecture I got a bad impression of her as her LEARN posts were very passive-aggressive. She highlighted that if you send her an email starting with \"hey\" she wouldn't even look at it and would immediately delete it. I understand it's important to be professional, though I feel this is quite extreme. It's supposed to be an in person course but it might as well be an online course because all the content is expected to be learned through screen casts she recorded in 2020 and the in person lectures are just for review and clicker questions. If I'm being honest, I only attended two in person lectures the whole semester because I found it so useless and the one time I asked her a question she told me to go watch her screencast instead of just telling me the answer right there (I had already watched the screen cast). Another thing that made me heavily dislike her is that for one of the midterms, she messed up one of the multiple choice questions where all answers were false whereas one was supposed to be true. Two of my friends brought it up to her and she gave everyone the mark thankfully (i think), but she for some reason felt the need to make a post basically calling the class stupid since only two people pointed out the mistake to her. It was her mistake and she is not an approachable person. I wouldn't be surprised if more people noticed the issue with the question but didn't feel comfortable bringing it up to her. My recommendations for the course are to do your work, push through and don't let the prof discourage you as she seems to just be a grumpy person.",
      "good course, poor instructor at least for me",
      "Very hard to know what Heidi's gonna put on her tests- tbh its a hard struggle to do good in this course, but its just one course all will be fine",
      "Pretty hard compared to high school but a lot of it is revision and if you study you can do well.",
      "Decent Course Bad Prof",
      "I see a lot of negative reviews for this course and Heidi but I have a bit of a different perspective as an upper year taking this course with no previous bio experience (not even high school). This course is an exercise in finding effective study strategies and understanding rather then memorizing content. Some people don't like the recorded lectures and that's fine but I personally loved them and you will too if your good at/like a more self directed learning style (and if you don't get used to it because a lot of your learning in uni will be self directed). The screencasts are clear and well presented. If you take the time to listen to what she emphasises in screencasts and review lectures the questions on exams become very expected and fair. Heidi might be a bit chaotic but she's made this course digestible and entertaining. She has been one of my favourite profs in my undergrad",
      "It can be annoying to have to watch all the online lectures (up to 2 hours total per unit) before class, but that's honestly the only way to do well in the course. As long as you stay on top of things (which can be hard) it's not too bad. "

      "This lab required an experiment every week so it was a major time sink to read, prepare a procedure, and do a short 15 minute quiz for each lab. This lab only had two reports, one worth 5% and the other worth 20%.  I recommend rereading your report to make sure that all your sentences are properly cited so that you do not lose marks. For the first report, they are lenient, where they only will give you a zero on a particular section if you do not cite properly (my heart sank when I got a 60 on my first report), but if you make the same mistake you will receive a 0 on your second report. The first half of the term for the lab, you will spend more time on each experiment as you will have to go into more detail to discuss it, but not so much at the end of the term. The lab exam was straightforward but some questions were oddly phrased to be perfectly honest. ",
      "This course was a significant amount of work! A lab quiz needed to be completed prior to entering the lab each week. These quizes were timed to a maximum of 15 minutes, therefore, you need to know the material and be able to type the answers very quickly. A summary also had to be completed before each of the labs. The course required that two lab reports be written (3 reports for a bonus). These reports were extremely time consuming, each could take approxiamtely 15+ hours to complete. Depending on your TA, the reports are often graded very harshly. The lab exam was fair, however, it is crucial that you be able to explain and understand the results of each of the labs. ",
      "Lab reports are the killer here, but doing the lab itself was pretty gun :)",
      "Honestly this lab was kind of pointless. It introduces you to the basics of lab techniques and electrophoresis but other than that this lab was boring. I had it 7-10pm too which didn't make it any better. The exam for this lab was pretty simple but I hated studying for it. ",

      "This was one of my favourite courses this semester! Here's a tip for anyone who is taking it in the future: you typically get quizzed on a series of questions relating to content in your lab book for the specific lab. For the majority of the semester it felt super stressful because you never knew what you were about to be asked, but as it turns out, if you click the rubric section on Learn, it gives you a list of the questions each week (the prof just doesn't want it advertised). The first lab was a bonus exercise where you learn how to craft a university biology lab (hyperlink, the fact that you can't have vertical lines in your tables or cite any websites). From then on you were to summarize the procedure in a flow chart in your green biology lab book (which you have to purchase from the STC media doc and must write in it in pen in order to receive a full 5% for your lab book check). You would have to complete 7 labs quizzes before your lab from which they take your 5 best marks. The quizzes can be fairly challenging and specific so make sure you really understand the content before attempting them! They have a time limit of 15 minutes which can be pretty tight, but won't sign you out automatically at 15 minutes, instead you have to submit the quiz yourself and have a two minute grace period, otherwise you get a zero on the lab. My advice for the two lab write ups is DISCUSS EVERY SINGLE RESULT even if you feel like you're being redundant. It's super easy to do well on these bio labs if you simply follow instructions. Overall a great lab, especially if your TAs rocked like mine did!",
      "Really easy lab. Expect to be there for the full 3 hours though sadly. Some minor complaints with how the lab manual is written but should be fixed in the following terms ",
      "Update: I later TA-ed this lab, there is no longer a final exam. Fairly easy, 2 formal lab reports. Lab is held every week.",
      "I'm not understanding everyone's issues with this course. It's just your basic 1A intro lab. Easy 90+ no problem. Lab reports took 10+ hours but ended up getting 90s on them. Pre-lab quizzes are only 15 minutes long with no MC, so you need to know your stuff before clicking that start button. Never saw the instructor once, you live and breath with the TAs. Some experiments you can get out of there after an hour or so, others you are struggling just to get all of your data and finish on time. Overall though its not a course that you should be worried about. Its a bird course and a GPA booster with no final. Besides the lab reports, 0% effort was put into this course. The real concerns should be with the lecture course itself. If you don't stay on top of things with BIOL 130, its hard to catch up. ",
      "One of the easiest labs you'll ever do. Before each lab is a pre-lab quiz that is each 15 mins long and requires pretty good knowledge as to what is going on. This is where if anything you'll lose marks (other than the lab reports) and unfortunately won't know which questions you got right or wrong as only the mark is given to you. The 2 lab reports do require that you put in the time to ensure that you do your best and is weighted accordingly (15%- for the first one and 20%-for the second one) . There are no final exam for this course and many of the labs are designed so that you only need 1 hour of the class to complete it. At the end of each lab is easy verbal (2 question) quiz which all students get the same questions. The TAs are very nice as well. Only disadvantage is that your mark does not get curved like it does in the CHEM 120 lab.",
      "Honestly highhhhhly dependant on your TAs, I got blessed with knowledgeable and easy markers so I ended this course with a 95. But I know friends in other sections who ended the course with low 80s. ",
      "Soft course just make sure you follow the rubric for lab reports and  you ask your TA for clarity cuz they all mark differently.",
      "I am a first year biology student who took this course in fall 2019. I thought that the lab was useful as we were given hands on experience to many laboratory techniques. I also thought that writing the formal lab reports was a great experience, however they were marked difficult (in comparison to the chemistry labs). There were a few instances where the students had to sit and wait for an extended period of time for the labs to finish, which could be frustrating at times. Overall though it was a good atmosphere and I enjoyed gaining experience in the labs!",
      "Easiest lab ever and very useful, you'll love it. Be careful about TA's though, my TA took off 50% on my last lab report worth a quarter of my mark because he took off a mark for every quotation mark he saw :( i wouldve gotten a great mark in the lab if it werent for that, but it didnt drop my average too much so im okay with it, i shouldve listened. Overall it was really fun though!",
      "I hated every bit of it yet I got a 95 and idk how.",
      "failed everyone on the first lab...",
      "I took this online (fall 2020). This course, in my opinion, was catastrophic due to a lack of communication between TAs and the instructor, between the TAs themselves, and timing issues. For instance, we had 3 weeks just to do an intro assignment worth 1% as well as our WHMIS and AIQs. Not needed. This resulted in 7 weeks of rushed lab reports (1 per week), when the 3 weeks from the beginning of the semester could have allowed for students to complete formal lab reports with some more time (especially considering they were worth 10 and 20%, respectively). Furthermore, there was inconsistency between the information each of the TAs were giving out. I found that my peers got more useful information than I did; things that my TA said she couldn't help me with were covered by other TAs. One useful thing is the fact that we had 30 minute office hours weekly, allowing us to know what to look out for, understand the grading scheme, clear doubts, etc. Overall, it is a course that is just not suited for online learning.",
      "this course barely has anything to do with BIOL 130 lol. really depends on your TA. i would just say to pay attention during both of the lab reports and READ THE INSTRUCTIONS don't be dumb like me, otherwise, it's fine. ",
      "The communication in this course was very poor. For example, different TAs would give their students very different expectations. This was a big deal for one of the reports where some students were given the expectation that they must add a specific thing to their lab reports and others were left with the information that said explicitly not to do that very same thing. This resulted in many students losing over 10% of their grade for that assignment despite it not being our fault. Honestly, if the communication had have been better, the course would have been substantially better. ",
      "Informal labs are very easy 90's. Formal labs are extremely hard (at least for me who's not good at labs)\nInteresting concepts. A bit tedious to read through all of the procedures. \nThey didn't give us enough background to understand results, so you need to email TA's. ",
      "like high school but more serious. dont be afraid to email your TAs & dont feel bad for bothering them because its the little details that really help for lab reports.",
      "As someone who loves writing lab reports in high school, this course presented a challenge in developing lab report writing skills but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Summary: the research is time consuming. Be prepared to spend hours researching for formal lab reports. Informal lab reports on Pebblepad are relatively easy, except for the fact that many results it asks for expects you to know what the expected results are for experiments many of us likely have never done before. Overall, easy lab course and do not be afraid to email your TAs with many questions! I cannot thank my TA enough for dealing with my emails, although she did not directly answer some. ",
      "Kinda fun. Also really stressful because of the time limit.",
      "Although BIOL 130L has taught me how to write a lab report, it takes up so much time that you will not have time for your other courses. The content is fairly easy however there is nothing given out in the class for approximately a month and then it starts... You will have lab reports due each week, the TA's are not clear with their expectations, mandatory lab office hours, writing flow charts for a lab which you are not even completing in-person, and much more. Would not take this class if it is not mandatory. ",
      "This course was a legitimate roller coaster of stress. This is my own fault but I left the first lab activity until the day of and freaked out over the amount of work that had to be done. About a month after I finished that activity (and after I had handed in 3 extra assignments) I got the first lab activity back, and my TA docked marks for stuff I didn't know I needed to include (because it wasn't in the rubric). About half way through I honestly considered dropping it but I'm glad I didn't because after the first couple assignments it gets so much less stressful. I almost bombed the first lab report but got almost perfect on the second one so I cant complain too much. After I got my first lab back I found out I got reported to the dean for an academic offence because I didn't cite something properly, and then I found out the TAs went crazy with reporting and almost half the class thought they were gonna get kicked out of school. Unnecessary stress honestly. Most of the stuff isn't clear in terms of the rubric, but the experiment post labs are easy 90s so that will bump your mark up if you didn't do great on the first lab report. ",
      "This course was kind of lacking. Heard absolutely nothing from the professor the entire term, and many of us had TA's that were useless, or were rude, and gave no constructive feedback. The information we learned was (or would have been) useful, but it was online, so take that with a grain of salt.",
      "this course was far too much work for the usefulness of the information we were being taught. Very little practical lab information was taught, and the labs focused only on the theory, which was mostly from high school. This did not feel like a lab class at all and it was a lot of work and stressful. The first formal lab report was graded extremely hard and i lost a lot of points for things that weren't made clear to us. my TA legitimately told me that the course was designed to have people do really bad on the first lab and then have to fix things for the second one, which i think is a very poor excuse for not making their expectations and requirements (for both small and big details) clear to us. there was often experiments that didn't work out well yet we were expected to get correct answers given wrong or often nonexistent information. There were no lab videos, just a written procedure and pictures of results, which resulted in a bad online lab experience and i feel like i missed out on a lot of important lab experience and knowledge.",
      "These lab courses really depend on your ta, mine were honestly find but i know some of my friends who were very picky, overall this lab course really did teach me how to properly write a lab report, and a formal one, the content itself is very easy, i would say one of the lab reports was very tedious as it took a long time to write, but it wasnt bad, not a bad course, uh for the prof, i did not see her the whole term, it really is just interactions with your ta",
      "Really rushed and disorganized course with ambiguous marking schemes. TAs have really different expectations. Could be handled a lot better",
      "I actually really liked this course! I did it online, which was unfortunate, but I actually liked the labs we did. I think how you think of this course, however, depends entirely on your TA. I loved mine, she was super nice and helpful, but I know others struggled because of their TA. Another thing is that the TAs sometimes had their own expectations, there was a bit of a difference in what each TA was looking for, so if you have a question and want to ask someone, ask your TA. \n\nI actually preferred this over chem 120L.",
      "I personally think that the TAs for this lab could make the assignments and the reports more clear. My TA would just post some material and would barely explain it. I recommend choosing your TA wisely and asking for help when needed. ",
      "The lab was run by a group of TAs (I never met the instructor) and it was incredibly disorganized. They did their best, but the TA materials and the required lab manual were unnecessarily confusing and contained multiple errors. All in all, it wasn't that bad. We did some interesting experiments but the work was very tedious.",
      "BIOL 130 lab was okay. Not my favourite lab but I definitely think it helps to enforce some topics covered in class. I find that the lab procedures contain many different steps and a lot of different experiments with not that much time to complete. I often found that my partner and I ran out of time in class or cut it really close since they were lengthy. Be sure to do all pre-lab quizzes and online labs, easy way to get good marks!",
      "Prof and TAs confusing and not helpful. Directions unclear for every lab and you could tell the TAs didn't want to be there. TAs taught course, saw the prof once in the very last lab but she didn't even address the class",
      "this was the most disorganized and chaotic class I have ever been enrolled in. Despite having pretty good TAs, the structure and organization of this lab is just horrendous. The lab section is run entirely by 2-3 TAs, who often did not have the answers to your questions, and have given me inconsistent answers. Instructions were sometimes vague and unclear, and there were often typos in tests and instructions. As well, you will never meet the professor unless you schedule a meeting specifically with them, they don't visit lab sections.",
      "This lab was terrible, especially compared to the CHEM 120L one. The course instructor made the lab manual and Learn content very confusing. It was so chaotic and disordered as the TAs have no idea what is on Learn and Learn is disorganized. As you see the lab is every 2 weeks, but do not be fooled, you have something to do every week without fail (whether it is online or in-person). The experiences were long and repetitive with unnecessary steps. You will have two \"big\" lab reports to write (10% and 20%). Since this lab is run by children (because the coordinator never comes around) so the TAs must do all the work, because of this instructors are different in every section, so I hope you have nicer ones than the horror stories my friends encountered. You will get through the lab and get a decent grade, it's just so frustrating. Use the slip days, talk to your friends, and read the lab book and you will get through this.",
      "This lab was overall very disorganized. Although I learned a lot of practical lab skills, the experience of doing the lab was not great. The TAs were not helpful in the sense that their instructions and responses to questions were confusing. I have also never seen the course instructor throughout the entire term. Not sure if it was just me, but I felt lost up until halfway into the course about the online labs and the pre-lab quizzes, the deadlines mentioned by the TAs, and the instructor, and the actual deadlines online did not match up. Definitely recommended actively checking these dates and other information regularly because they can be very easily missed. ",
      "This lab was so disorganized compared to CHEM 120L. The TAs also gave me inconsistent and incorrect answers to my questions. Some of my TAs didn't even know what we were doing. They never responded to my emails and the marking was unnecessarily harsh. The content covered was useful and reinforced bio concepts from the lecture component, but otherwise, I dreaded going to this lab every other week. I preferred chem 120L way more, the vibes were a million times less dreadful. My TA was so scary even the other two TAs didn't like her.",
      "really have to work in this lab + have very nice tas to get a high mark. like other people said chem 120l was much formatted than biol 130l, esp since there are online labs in biol 130l but no final exam. never saw the prof around. work hard on the two lab reports (10% + 20%) and the lab book (20%) and make sure u look like u know what u are doing in the lab for the 10% subjective mark. also do the bonus assignment worth 3% to bring up mark. also in f22 prof gave 2% bonus to complete a beginning and end of term survey.",
      "This course was arguably my most confusing class...I had 3 TA's for my section who ran every single lab and I never even met the lab instructor, Jola Gurska. The TA's had such different marking schemes although they were supposedly following the same criteria. One of the TA's marked everybody's first lab report very poorly for errors such as sentence structure or using too many brackets (in my case!), so it was unfair to the individuals who had this same TA for both lab reports since they got marked considerably lower for comparable scientific writing quality (to other peers who happened to get good marks on their reports because they were graded by any of the other 2 TA's in the section). Also, the TA's were not on the same page when asked the exact same question, I always received different answers from each TA. It was a very disorganized course although I somehow ended up with a pretty good mark (from things such as bonus marks for doing a survey and an extra assignment for an optional lab, and also the lab book marks were marked pretty easily, at least in my section). Overall, I thought the lab content reinforced concepts learned in BIOL 130 lecture component pretty nicely, but the course could have been more well put-together. Good luck!",
      "Extremely unorganized - the instructor (that you will never meet) is unclear, so the TAs are always confused and so we, the students, are also always confused. I genuinely believe that the difficulty of this course stems solely from the lack of communication and organization. For the weekly quizzes, it's possible to do well, but don't expect clear explanations in the lab manual (for some reason). Anticipate doing external research to solidify your understanding. As for the lab reports, you will be writing one worth 10% in your first week of the lab. A lot of the TAs are very picky and will completely tear it apart. You may get a good grade, but you also may not. It depends more on your TA than your quality of work from my experience. So use those quizzes as easy marks (to allow leeway on the lab reports) and don't mess up on the meiosis assignment like I did because it's worth 10% too. A lot of people are comparing it to CHEM 120L and that's just because the level of organization in 120L made this one increasingly unbearable. The only good thing about it is that there's no final exam, so once you manage to make it through a lab report or a quiz, you can discard the information entirely.",
      "I didn't find it too bad, though a lot of people got absolutely slammed on the first lab report due to citation errors that took off a massive amount of their grade. The lab itself wasn't difficult at all. ",
      "Easy labs. Boring labs.",
      "The labs themselves for this course are relatively easy, but there can be a lot of waiting which can be a bit frustrating. The coruse itself is pretty unorganised, and most of the time the prof wouldn't tell the TAs what was expected, which led to a lot of confusion, especially when we had to hand in things during the lab. I remember having to draw a diagram 5 times because the prof and TAs kept changing the requirements. It's pretty annoying to have online labs in between actual labs, but they can be a mark booster if you do them correctly. ",
      "Super unorganized course. The TA's were often very unhelpful as they would either give students inconsistent answers to the same questions or would be as clueless as the students. Then, the instructor was never really present in the lab and I'm pretty sure I saw her pass by twice the entire semester. It was an introductory course so it makes sense her priorities would be elsewhere but it left the students confused very often because the TA's were equally confused all the time. "

This course however kind of goes all over the place and it can get really confusing but comes together in the end and everything connects. Keep up with the readings since there are quizzes before each lesson based on the textbook readings. You should really invest in the textbook for this course (its a modified one so its pretty inexpensive). This course is good for helping you get a feel for how to connect your other bio courses to the real world!",

The quiz questions also have conflicting answers, as sometimes the textbook is different than the lecture. Also, I don't know why this course is called \"organismal and evolutionary ecology\" because there really isn't any evolution involved. Readings are very boring.

Attending class was not necessary as he only read off the slides. Textbook is highly recommended for the quizzes and there are no \"participation marks\" in this class.

      "I am a first year biology student who took this course in fall 2019. I personally thought that this course was not very useful (at least for me), it contained a lot of information that I considered to be common sense. It went into a lot of detail about relatively simple concepts. That being said, I did think that the course was relatively easy. The midterm and exam were both fair, however the online quizzes were very odd and meant to trick you. In this class we also used a SimBio module, which was an interactive online module that was useful but also very time consuming. The textbook is not essential, but it does follow the course very closely so it is a good reference guide. This course does not require a lot of attention, but be sure to understand the concepts well before the tests and exams.",
      "Fairly content heavy, weekly quizzes that will boost your mark. Midterm and final were quite difficult. Final was non-cumulative but I don't believe that it normally is. ",
      "Took this course in Fall 2020 completely online due to COVID. \nDon't know how this course is normally when it is in-person, but I found it to be very easy remotely.\nDr. Rooney clearly wants you to get the highest mark you possibly can, which is why the marking scheme is so flexible.\nThe marking scheme was 30% Final Exam, 15% quizzes (best 20 out of 22), 20% Concept Maps (best 4 out of 5), 20% simulations (best 2 out of 3) and 15% discussion posts (best 4 out of 5).\nThe content for this course is not hard itself especially for unit 1, which is basically a review of high school biology, but the marks for this unit were bad as it was initially unclear how to do good on the concept map and discussion posts.\nAs I went through the term my marks on concept marks shot up. There was even a 2% bonus assignment that was really easy and fun.\nI was able to finish this class with a 98%.\nMost students lose marks for not making discussion posts and might end up doing too much work like I initially did.\n",
      "As a student who took this online during COVID-19, the course was a breeze. All content was on SimuText, which embedded questions throughout and at the end of chapters to solidify your understanding and super easy. Other course content including concept maps and discussions were also easy. Participate in the discussions and refer to the rubric for 100%. Concept maps were a little tough for me simply because I\u2019m not that great at them, but not a killer. Overall, the course was enjoyable as someone who has an interest for animals, but the exam was a bummer. Loads of questions (T/F, multiple choice and one typed-answer) and a few difficult calculations with limited time. Would have been better if the time was not cut down last minute. Either way, an easy 90%+. ",
      "I hated this course at first and didn't give it a shot for the rest of the term but I regret it. The weather stuff in the beginning is super boring but I now understand that it's needed.  I wish I stayed engaged because the animal behaviour unit was amazing!!! ",
      "course was pretty good and all on simultext for the pandemic. the equations gave me brainworms as i am pretty bad with math especially when its remixed to suit a biological context, so study the equations and practice the population problems. overall the course was meh but its a very soft intro to the juicier ecology courses later on. \n\nyou gotta do mindmaps, 3-4 simulation labs, discussion posts and weekly quiz stuff that boosts your mark liken crazy. there was only one exam which was the final and i wasnt really preapred for an exam in this class",

He also shares little extra stuff he does in the field as well and it's so wholesome. \n\nI like the simutext because it's a way to study interactively without feeling like you're stressed to complete the work. This whole course was a break from the stress of all my other courses, and made me consider a career path in ecology in the future.\n\nThe only critique I would have is that the concept map isn't introduced clearly at first, which makes it hard to get good grades for them initially. I did improve and got high grades on my last three, but the first two were rough.",
      "Boring. Uses only an online textbook, which was easy to read but somewhat redundant. the software also wasn't always cooperative. the content was lots of common sense concepts with some obscure formulas thrown in. it wasn't super clear on how to apply the formulas or interpret the results outside of very specific examples that were talked about for way too long. thankfully the course didn't require much time overall, though i woud recommend starting the modules a couple days before theyre due becuase they can be long and boring plus you don't want to get stuck with technical issues the day its due. also, you were expected to make several discussion posts so i would just recommend pretending you're dumb and didnt understand the incredibly simple concepts when asking questions. when you are answering questions, overexplain and maybe throw in something slightly related.",
      "Great prof! He's super nice and posts the material all in one webpage, which made it easy to navigate. He adds short lectures, but most of the content is learnt from the Simutext, which is a virtual textbook with many practice questions. The content throughout the term was easy, although there were many assignments that could be time consuming if you were to leave it all at the last minute. There were reading quizzes at the end of each textbook chapter, each was worth less than a percent and very easy; there were also concept maps, discussion posts, and a couple lab simulations. If you don't do so well on an assignment, don't stress! He only only counts the best 4/5 concept maps, 4/5 discussion posts, etc. There's no midterm or term tests, just a final exam, although... that was a bit difficult. Since there are no term tests or midterm, it may be a little hard to test your understanding, especially with the math side of the course. I also felt as if the time limit given was a bit stressful. Still, aside from the final exam, I loved learning the content of the course! It was my favourite that semester. It's a shame I'm not interested in the field of ecology, but this course was great. ",
      "I did pretty well in this course. Rebecca Rooney was a really nice professor. Definitely a professor worth having in undergrad. ",
      "The path I want to take in the future doesn't really relate to this course, but it was a requirement for my program. I think it would be interesting to those who like history of biology and how things came to be. It wasn't necessarily hard, just keep up with the SimuText readings and labs cause these are easy marks and some concepts come up again! Also there is only a midterm and final, so not much room to see how you're progressing in the course unless it's on SimuText.",

Lots of terminology and life cycles to remember for a whole wack of spp. If you like the stuff covered in this course it can be really interesting (I really enjoyed this course). Pinherio makes this course a lot easier to learn about and he really engages you in lecture. The midterms and exams are hard, but pretty fair if you study hard enough for them. I recommend making cue cards with spp names and whatnot on them so you can test yourself (knowing spp names is KEY in courses like this). The textbook is mandatory (I 100% recommend buying it since it's also your course notes for the term) and its one of the few textbooks I don't regret buying and that I actually used.

I recommend keeping organized charts of the various groups of organisms as you go along, it makes it much easier to study for the tests/exam. Textbook is useful but not required to do well. ",

I did not study other than create flow charts that summarized all supergroups and their clades, phylums, subphylums and the life cycles involved. You do not need the textbook to pass, I didn\u2019t use it at all. An easy 90%+, especially if you had a cooperative BASS module group. The BASS component made up ~20% of your final grade and it was a term-long group project. I had an amazing, responsible group so I was able to get 100% on the BASS portion. ",
      "This was by far my favorite class this semester. It is essentially one step up from BIOL 110 with slightly more nuanced topics. For me, the first half of the course was online which was somewhat of a bore, but the second half was great. What really made this course stand out for me was just how invested Pinheiro is regarding the topics he is discussing. Whether he is discussing ciliates, complex life cycles, or whatever it may be, he is always very enthusiastic! Although the course content can come off as uninteresting on occasion, Pinheiro always saves it with his enthusiasm and great attitude. Overall, the course is quite fair and as long as you study the life cycles, you should do well!",

A textbook is not required as all the questions are based on the screen casts recorded. The most frustrating part is probably the BASS groups as you do not really need to spend 20 minutes working with a group of 5 people to write 1 multiple choice question. This course requires a lot of memorization especially when it comes to dozens of life cycles and focuses on the similarities/differences within the 3 domains and 5 supergroups.

Dr. Dayeh does a great job going through the content, and she tests mainly everything from the notes directly, with some information from the textbook, but anything not covered in class won't be touched.",
      "Absolutely loved this course. Great marking scheme. 40% is lab work that is pretty simple and easy marks. There are 2 midterms worth 25% each and no final. Also the second midterm wasn't cumulative of the whole semester so it only contained material from after the first midterm. The remaining 10% was from creating study questions which can then be used to study for the midterms. The course was also incredibly interesting.",
      "straight memorization required for this course. the two tests were super fair and easy (with hard work of course lol). i got an 85 on the first test and a 99 on the second. even tho the lecture component was very easy for me, I think the lab component was deliberately structured to bring down your mark. the first oral exam was especially brutal because the diagrams weren't from the atlas or textbook like I thought they would be (got a 30 on that, it was my first assessment for this course too so I was super bummed out). don't take this course lightly like i did just because it was recently changed from 301 to 201. it still requires a lot of work. after that first low mark, I grinded it out and ended up scoring very well on all the other assessments. we haven't gotten our final grade back but from my calculation, i finished this course with an 85",
      "In terms of marking it was fair, I'll give it that. But this course made me realize I don't ever want to become a doctor. If you want to be a doctor -take this course. I never get panic or anxiety attacks and this course triggered me so bad. ",
      "This course is interesting and covers a lot of content you have already learned in physiology courses and high school (just more detailed). Dr. Dayeh is a great lecturer and her non-cumulative midterms are fair (no final!). The lab is definitely a mark booster if you just review the content the day before. The dissections can be a bit gross but you get used to it (not the smell tho). ",
      "Such an easy and fun course, especially if you are good at memorizing. Don't be fooled, this is a strict memorization course outside of the two small practice-question assignments you do (don't lose free marks by making memory-recall type questions like I did). Make flashcards, use online resources and games to learn content and make good use of the lab component. Did not put in a whole lot of effort and finished with a 90.",

      "There is a lot to memorize. It is moderately interesting but very tedious to study. Labs were easy and mostly fun. ",
      "I thoroughly enjoyed this class despite there being a lot of memorization involved. The labs were easy and fun and Vivian Dayeh was a great prof! Personally, I found the content to be very interesting but I wouldn't recommend this class unless you have a genuine interest in zoology because it would be really tedious and boring to study for otherwise. ",
      "Awesome course! Interesting content. Just know your lab manual inside and out before heading in to the lab!",
      "lots of memorization",
      "This was one of my favourite courses that I've taken at UW. There was definitely some memorization involved but the labs were very interesting and I loved learning about different animals. All of the exams were fair and as long as you know the information in the course notes you should do well.",
      "Easy if you put the work in. No required textbook, so all tested material came from the lectures. Tests were extremely fair and very easy as they ask about things he directly said in class. Pay attention in lectures and it should be easy.",
      "The labs were awesome and fun! I would have dropped this course if it weren't for the labs. Overall, the content is super fun to learn and the course was well organized. However, the test content was straight from the textbook, and a lot was not covered in the lectures. The lecturer tried to reciprocate textbook content during lectures but evidently forgot to mention several important points.",
      "Loved the labs, it was so fun! Studied lab content a day before and easy A. Lecture was a bit more tricky, do have to memorize \n",
      "This course is super fun, the lab component is absolutely the best part. This class is really low maintenance, there was no homework, just optional textbook readings. Make sure to study well for the weekly lab quizzes and tests though! ",
      "LECTURE:\nAll the content that could be tested comes from the lecture, so the textbook isn't needed. There are 3 term tests, and no final exam. Each test took place during the lecture period, so you had 50 minutes to do it. The test questions were a mix of MC, T/F, and short answers. There weren't any super tricky questions or questions about something we hadn't seen before, so they were pretty fair.\n\nLABS:\nThe labs were pretty fun. There's quite a bit of content you have to read through and memorize if you want a good grade. Every week, you choose 2 slips of paper out a bucket with 2 questions on them, so 4 questions in total. They range in difficulty; some will ask you to point to a body part on a model and some will ask you to explain the purpose/role of something. The dissections themselves were easy. I always got full marks and the TAs usually explain the instructions in a simpler way.",
      "Not a bio student, and this course was pretty good! It took a lot of effort and exams are pretty content heavy. Labs were fun and chill with small quiz at the end. Most of the time, the TAs just gave you a 100% on the quizzes anyway. Final lab project is super easy. Interesting class."

      "The first half of the material was interesting, the second half was not so interesting. 3 midterms, a bunch of online quizzes and one group presentation. Overall, will probably raise your mark, it is not hard to do well if you study a decent amount. Dr. Lolle is a good professor.",
      "This course isn't what the comments make it out to be. The content itself isn't super challenging, but Dr. Chuong does make the three-term tests quite hard, with the average being around 55% this term. The content covered doesn't really relate to anything else in any other course and oftentimes is just random facts that don't relate to anything else covered in the course. It's all pretty much just memorizing the slides and hoping that you wrote down everything he said in class, as he loves putting in questions about things he mentions once in class. Overall not a great course and definitely not worth taking, in my opinion."

      "This course was actually a lot more interesting than I thought it would be! Tutorials were very helpful when I didn't understand something during the lectures. Lots of memorization though for midterm & final! ",
      "Genetics with Dupont was actually really interesting and went pretty well. You're going to have to keep up throughout the term, but she uploads podcasts on Learn after each class so make sure you take advantage of that. If you don't understand something, go to her office hours and please ask her! She's nicer than she seems.",
      "Great Prof, relatively easy. Podcast was extremely helpful",
      "Study hard and pay attention. As Duxbury warned us, the material becomes heavy after the first midterm. This is true. A lot of this course is a review from high school but there is quite a bit of new content or just harder material in general. Not a hard course if you work hard. The tutorial provides lots of opportunity to get small marks.",
      "Less memorizing than BIOL 130, but those mitosis/meiosis units can drive you crazy. Mandatory tutorials--they check attendance and assign group work & assignments. ",
      "I found the material rather simple to grasp, you just need to study enough for this. ",
      "This is an interesting course and is not too bad. There are weekly tutorials with mandatory attendance but were never too burdensome. The midterm was fair and was easy thanks to the practice midterm Dr. Dupont posts on LEARN. Some questions on the final were kinda gimmicky (by that I mean pure memorization), but it was overall very fair and interesting. Dr. Dupont also gives out 5% bonus for completing activities and that really helped me boost up my final grade.",
      "more than half of this course is review from grade 12 genetics. 5% optional bonus is a huge help!",

      "EXTREMELY easy. There is no reason not to get 90+ with minimal efforts if you have Dupont. Studying from the course notes is more than sufficient.",
      "Pretty easy course as long as you keep up with the material and do lots of practice questions, exams basically from practice questions",
      "Way better than BIOL 130 in terms of material. Very interesting! Not a bird course tho, you really need to stay on top of it. If you get Dr. Dupont, the midterm is VERY much like the practice midterm she gives out so make sure you do it! The final was definitely harder but not too bad imo (I mean I haven't got my mark back yet so idk lol). Take advantage of all the bonus marks she gives out! Overall a great course! ",
      "Material wasn't too difficult, easy to do well in the course if you keep up with the lessons. Practice midterm is almost identical to the actual one, final is composed of the challenging material presented at the end of the course. ",
      "Took the course with Duponte. Fairly easy. Textbook wasn't needed. Try to get into the same tutorials as your friends, since there is some graded group work (not assignments, more like group work tests). Do the 5% bonus - it's really easy and it's actually pretty significant to your grade. Also, Duponte posts practice midterm and exam questions that are pretty much the same as what you see on the test. \n",
      "great course, very interesting material!  The course can be difficult at times so just try and stay on top of the material ",
      "Overall, this is a very interesting course! The material is relevant to real life. There is only one mid-term exam - which is strikingly similar to the practice exam. The final exam is more challenging. Dupont awards five additional bonus marks if you complete a series of \"learning activities,\" which are extremely easy, so, its definitely possible to get a good mark in this course! Stay on top of the material and a 90% is possible. ",
      "easiest bio course ever",
      "Loved this class!!! SUPER FAIR EASY 90+ Midterm basically same as practice midterm and final exam was fair. Good course to dive into research ",
      "A very fair course, you will get the mark you deserve, and based on the amount of effort you will put in. The tutorial section is a great mark booster, plus bonus marks available in the lecture never hurt.",
      "worst course ever!! The final is a killer, literally, everyone guessed the whole final ",
      "Great course! Keep up with it and find a good TA. Some mark very hard in tutorials which could easily drop your mark. ",
      "Excellent content and taught in a nice way. Doesn't require you to know a lot of details. Little memorization, more problem solving than a typical biology course.",
      "Dupont was a bit dry, I preferred her podcasts because I could speed her up. Nevertheless, put in the work for the tutorial; It can be a mark booster or a mark killer.",
      "It's like BIO 130 but with a focus on genetic. It's a lot of information jammed into one course and can be hard to pick up and understand from just listening to the lecture. The midterm is really similar to the practice midterm. Midterm and final exam I found were difficult. The questions were often very specific or just overall questions I wasn't expecting. The tutorial is a good mark booster and similar calculations from it are seen on the final exam. ",
      "It's pretty easy if you go to class. There are many small assignments/quiz that make up your mark so be sure to complete those as best as you can.  Definitely go over tutorial questions and come to them prepared. Also, she Dupont tries to make you to buy an extra 5% by getting the interactive etext but it's probably worth getting to study.",
      "The course was built to that there are weekly lectures and tutorials - the lectures introduced the material and the tutorials were a great chance to get some practice working with the material! Make sure you take the tutorial assignments and tests seriously, as they help a lot when it comes to studying for the midterm and the final! Oh, and the new smartbook quizzes (for bonus marks) are great at testing out your familiarity with the material - just make sure you don't leave them all to the last minute!",
      "interesting class, definitely need to put the work in. midterm wasn't too hard but exam was a lot harder than expected. smartbook bonus marks are awesome, takes some time but worth the effort for the free 5%. ",
      "fairly easy course if you keep on top of course work. Tutorials give out easy marks,  and the midterm was fair, with a few identical questions pulled out from the practice midterm. Easy 85+ for putting in some work. Also dupont records all lectures!",
      "This course is very interesting & features a very generous marking scheme: A free 5% for completing online learning activities, 25% midterm, 40% exam, and 30% tutorial (further broken down into a bunch of things: a free 2% for viewing videos, 3% for tutorial group work, 5% for a very short, online (open book) quiz,  7% report,  4% for another group work, 2% subjective mark, 7% tutorial exam). You should take advantage of the tutorial and use it as a mark booster. The content of the course is a mix of high school review with a bit of new stuff, and the focus is less on mass memorization and more on application of concepts than your typical biology course. Everything you need to know is in Christine's slides (though they may seem a bit sparse). Don't forget to study the diagrams, as they get VERY important in the later units involving experiments and laboratory processes. Easier than BIOL 130 if you've taken that as Christine doesn't try as hard to trick you on the multiple choice as Heidi did in 130 (ex/ there are very rarely \"a and b\" or \"a and c\" options) and because Christine doesn't say things not on the slideshows which end up being tested like Heidi did. Not to say that Christine's tests are easy...fair is the best way to describe them. Also, on top of this already generous marking scheme, you get an extra 5% tacked onto your mark for buying the online textbook and completing the practice qs *cough* or just do all the qs in the free 2 week trial and save yourself $100 *cough*. Midterm average was 73, exam average was 61. This seems pretty low but I still believe both were fair. Despite this, the class average was definitely much higher because of tutorial and bonus 5%, so you only need to do meh on the midterm/exam to get a good mark.  Based on all of this, a high 80 is very doable if you don't go to class and just grind Christine's podcasts and really are able to do her practice qs. If you actually put a lot of work in, 90 is easy (85% mark + 5% bonus). Overall, a very interesting, application-oriented course with a generous marking scheme (provided you make use of the tutorial marks).and a knowledgeable, organized prof where you can do well without going to class as long as you make up for it by grinding appropriately when the time comes.",
      "Although this course has no prerequisites, it moves rather quick and introduces many terms as some form of implicit knowledge. Tutorial are mandatory. Multiple choice questions tests you on details. Lots of free points throughout the course though. Definitely an interesting course. ",
      "I took this course as a science elective, and found it very interesting. The course content is not very complicated, but the midterm and final can be tricky because of how the multiple choice questions are worded.",
      "It was literally review of high school Genetics there may be a few new concepts but all were more or less simple. The tutorials though man were a pain but you could work through them and the TA's would usually go through them anyways.",
      "the smartbook bonus saves lives",
      "The mark breakdown was super free but stay on top of all the deadlines because there are a lot of things to keep track of. There are weekly quizzes, learning activities, video questions that could be done on a weekly basis. There's also tutorials and practice quizzes (not mandatory) which help prepare you to do well on quizzes. The assignments are pretty low in mark value but do test you well on the concepts. The lectures were really well organized and really interesting with lots of examples. The content itself is not too difficult as long as go through the weekly work (maybe 5 hours all inclusive). I took this course out of interest (not part of the science department or need it as a degree requirement), but I really enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone who is interested in genetics!",
      "I personally loved this course! The content is very interesting: chromosomes, gene mapping, genetic code, population genetics, mutations, cloning, etc. The course consists of one midterm and a final exam. It also has a weekly tutorial which is helpful for learning how to solve different problems in the course. I highly recommend getting the textbook, it was very helpful in my opinion!",
      "the tutorials are the most important. buy the ebook the extra 5% will add up. the lac operon is the worst of it",
      "Had Dupont who was a great professor, but the TAs for this course were absolutely awful. Frequently made mistakes marking the weekly quizzes (sometimes completely forgot to mark entire questions) and were difficult with regrading requests until professor intervened. Honestly not hard to do well in this course if you put the effort in. And make sure you double-check your mistakes for grading errors. Final was 45 questions in one hour (online term due to COVID) so honestly it was kind of brutal but the bonus marks will save you. ",
      "course was easy until the final (for reference the average for the final was ~55%). if we're ignoring the final for a sec, the course is really interesting and taught very well. some concepts were somewhat difficult but with practice and paying attention during the tutorials it's not impossible. some of the material is completely new and some of it is just a repetition of grade 12 bio. now, the final was absolutely horrible and it made my average drop around 10%, thank god for the 5% bonus (which you should ABSOLUTELY take!). ask questions, pay attention and study hard for the final thats worth half of your mark. ",
      "I really liked this course but that's not to say I did good on it loll. Everything up to the final was pretty easy and the quizzes were really fair. As long as you understand tutorial content you'd do well. The final was a whole different thing. I think because there was never any tutorials on the last few modules so the concepts were really only explained on a surface level. Super enjoyable though, lectures were always interesting because Dupont would include a bunch of examples to explain different theories. Please buy the textbook, the extra 5% is worth it trust me. ",
      "As a non-science student - I felt that if you didn't study Gr 12 bio, it'd be pretty confusing. Final exam was pretty tough but really interesting content and great speaker. ",
      "Great topics in this course which were relevant to everyday science. If you keep on top of the assignments and practice questions you will do very well.",
      "Honestly, one of my favourite classes I had taken online first year in Winter '21. The only downside to the class was the amount of lectures, but I was very motivated for this class so I finished either half or all the Sunday before the week began. Content was interesting and intriguing, and as long as you paid attention and understood, the weekly quizzes due on Friday were extremely easy. Assignments were also fun and easy, I especially liked the Drosophila assignment and Lac Operon assignment was straight forward and easy as well. Everything was amazing apart from the final exam. I had amazing grades, but got around a 60% on the exam. It caught a lot of students off guard, especially because it focused on a concept that we only briefly brushed over (DNA sequences and such). The exam review was also misleading, said it would be sufficient to review tutorials and the exam review sheet, however, doing all that did not help to be honest lmao. I would highly recommend purchasing SmartBook for the 5% bonus, saved tons of our asses. ",
      "I enjoyed this class. I find Genetics to be one of the more interesting Biology courses in terms of content. The course content was pretty straight forward, 3 fair mid terms worth 8%, 9%, and 8%, a few assignments, and a final. The course is pretty easy until the final, which caused an almost 50% failure rate before the curve. I didn't find the final horrible, but I studied an absurd amount and still didn't do as well as I wanted. Overall, a pretty interesting and engaging course, STUDY HARD FOR THE MID TERMS AND FINAL!",
      "As someone who hadn't taken any bio courses in highschool, the molecular biology section of this course kinda had me lost. Aside from that, the Mendelian genetics portion was really interesting, and the quizzes and learning assessments were pretty fair and even enjoyable. That final though...make sure you brush up on your multiple choice skills haha.",
      "the course content itself was pretty interesting. there are three term tests, all worth 8 or 9 percent. these tests are pretty easy, but the thing is, it only tests the first half of the course content, which is easy as it focuses on mendelian genetics, pedigrees, and stuff like that. the second half is more of molecular biology, focusing on transcription, translation, etc. the exam was worth 45%, 80% of it was on content after term test 3, and i think thats why many people found it much more difficult than the tests. my class especially found the exam difficult, we had a nearly failing average. the prof is known not to curve, but i guess we did so bad, she had no choice but to curve. \n\n her wording for questions may be confusing, so reread the question a few times, especially for the term tests as you have a lot of extra time. \n\ntheres also this 5% bonus option in which you answer textbook questions. they are very, very long, but doing them really is worth it. \n\nas for the prof, she really seems nice, but her voice may be a bit monotone.  the good thing is, she posts her lectures, so you can go back and watch them. ",
      "This class was my favourite biology class to date. The concepts are fairly easy and but like all biology courses, there are a lot of terms. Most people found the term tests and final difficult but if you put in the work and really apply yourself it will come. I highly recommend doing the smart book activities as its an easy 4% back. Also, note that completing these activities is a very useful way to study. You MUST actually read the textbook when doing these activities. Also for some study tips for the test make a Quizlet throughout the year for all of the lecture sets (terms on one side and images and notes on the other). Then when it's time for a test get out a notebook and write down and draw everything you know about this term. It's all about recall practice. I spent a whole weekend studying for the final and got a 91 before the curve. If you put in the work you'll be rewarded it's that simple.",
      "I took this course as an elective. There is a fair amount of content to keep track of, but it's mostly really interesting, and the course is well organized to keep you on track. Definitely recommend the course if you are interested in Biology.",
      "This was the hardest course I have ever taken. Incredibly disorganized, and prof is retiring, so she does not care about feedback she receives. Exam was ridiculously hard, tests are not terrible. Because I got COVID during my term, I missed a mandatory tutorial making my final exam worth 49% of my final grade.",
      "if you do the readings its so easy",
      "The content itself is not too difficult, some concepts were previously covered in BIOL 130. However, do expect for some concepts to go a step beyond the level that is was covered in BIOL 130. The thing that makes this course difficult is the way it is organized. Please, DO NOT RELY ON THE COURSE NOTES THEY ARE AWFUL. A gamete suffering from aneuploidy could make better course notes. Simply use the course notes & lectures as a secondary source. Your primary source for learning and note-taking should be the textbook (which you can find for free on libgen.is). You can learn everything in this course in great detail using the textbook, don't waste too much time with the lectures and course notes. Anyways, The End? idk.",
      "This was the most interesting course I've taken so far at UW. A lot of content is covered in this course but it offers a great foundation for future courses. If you've taken BIOL 130 this is a good continuation of the DNA replication and cancer units. I loved how the history aspects of the subject was explored and the scientists who contributed to this field were highlighted. I recommend doing the extra textbook assignments to get easy marks and help with studying.",
      "This course was very interesting, but pretty disorganized. The marking scheme was odd and the course was composed of many small graded components. There was a drosophila assignment, learning activities, 2 in-tutorial assignments, a mitosis and meiosis quiz, and 3 tests that were only worth 8-9%. There was also the option to do the smartbook activities which were a bonus 5%. Personally, I felt that the effort you had to put in for some of the quizzes and assignments was not properly reflected in how much they were worth. For example, we had a 3 part assignment that spanned over 3 weeks, and it was only worth 9% yet a tutorial group assignment was worth 5% and we only had 20 minutes to complete it. I took BIOL 240 (microbiology) before this course, so that definitely helped with the molecular biology and cloning topics that were covered. Overall, the content is pretty straightforward and the questions asked on the term tests were fair. However, I did find the exam to be pretty rough. Some people may have a different experience in this course moving forward though since the prof that currently teaches it is retiring. ",
      "first half is easy (medelian genetics, pedigrees), second half isnt (molecular biology). structure of the course is super strange and imo doesnt prepare u for the final exam but might change since prof is retiring. 6% online learning assignments (open till end of term, just for completion) + 4% tutorial (in class group assignment, mitosis/meiosis chromosomes), 5% online tutorial quiz (5 questions) + 9% drosophila assignment (seperated into 3 parts, slideshow is provided that shows step by step on how to complete it) + 4% tutorial (in class group assignment, lac operon [pretty hard imo, read it carefully and ask ta for help]) + 2% subjective tutorial mark (as of writing this review idk whatmy mark is still) + 25% term test (8% + 9% + 8%, online and practice is representative of actual test but all three only cover the first easy half of the course). buy the $50 smartbook quizzes, will boost ur mark by 5% for completion, its long but worth it. as of writing this review i got no clue if there there was a curve on exam, imo the exam wasnt hard but got clapped and dropped my mark by 10%.\nediting my review to say that the final exam average was a 53% and there was 0 curve, overall class average was a 64.37%",
      "a lot of content, personally not a fan of the slides layout, exam was fair tho, nothing crazy like the earlier reviews though the average was around 50s for the whole course. the bonus definitely helped but are very time consuming and not really useful for the later half of the course",
      "A lot of the review will say that this course sucks and that Dupont sucks. From what I've heard, she's retiring so maybe it doesn't matter anyway, but I personally don't think she's a bad prof and the course isn't bad. The people who will leave a bad review say the course is impossible to follow because they don't pay attention in the lectures. However, if you take good notes during the lectures and actually pay attention (if you're attending them in the first place), it's not hard to do well in this course. You will have to put some time in to review the lecture slides because there is a lot of new content and she does go over it fairly quickly. But if you review the material, you will understand it and become clear and comprehendible. Our course consisted of 3 quizzes (around 7-9% each), mandatory tutorial (the tutorials themselves were super useless, but the practice questions were helpful), a few assignments, a 45% final, and a really long optional bonus. The course was interesting overall.",
      "Although the exam average was 53%, I really liked this class. Class breakdown was 6% learning activities, 25% tests (was for 3 tests), 8% for 2 tutorial activities, 5% quiz (mitosis and meiosis), 9% drosophila assignment, 2% tutorial participation and 45% exam. First part of the course was straightforward, was harder during the last part (more about sequencing and molecular genetics). Keep up with the course content during the entire semester (I recommend quizlet or anki to create flashcards) as it reduces the burden when studying for the exam. Test questions were sometimes confusing, but was okay. A lot of people complain that the professor (Dupont) is too slow, but I thought she went at the right pace! Lecture slides are a bit lackluster, but was reasonable. Would recommend looking at the textbook to piece information together. Speaking of the textbook, Dupont offers a 5% bonus (which you should get) for activities based on the textbook. They are a bit tedious, but are worth it (bought it for $50). If anything needs to change, they are the tutorials. I hated them, nothing really happened and were not engaging. Pretty useless part of the course. Overall, course was good, but may change as Dupont is retiring so take the review with a grain of salt.",

      "A nice general course on microbiology; covers many core concepts useful in upper years.",
      "Interesting course, fairly easy, great prof",
      "Useful and interesting course, but a lot to know.",
      "Similar to genetics in terms of amount of material to know and memorize overall a very interesting course. Neufeld is bae. ",
      "Lecture slides were easy to follow and add notes to in lecture",
      "Microbiology was amazing. Learning about the different diversity microbes that exist within our world and how they can affect humans and other species. Overall great course! Midterm and Final exam were extremely fair ",
      "It was a good biology course. Really liked it, keep up with the lectures. ",
      "Go to your own section for iclicker participation ",
      "Very typical biology course, involving lots of rote memory and the occasional need to apply some of the theory. Can be a particularly dry course if you do not have an interest in microbiology itself. But nonetheless, keep up with the material and it should be a course that is definitely possible to do well in. ",
      "basic intro microbe course",
      "Took the course online, it was a breeze compared to in class! ",
      "Never take this course online. I hated every minute of it. The assignments have nothing to do with the course material. There is a group assignment that was also a gigantic waste of my time. The lectures are dull and boring. There could be so much done to improve the way this course was taught in order to garner interest in the material.",
      "It was a pretty straightforward memorization class. Still found it covered interesting topics, and would definitely recommend to anyone who is interested in microbiology (especially if you can get Laura Sauder as your professor).",
      "This was a very enjoyable course! A good mix of old and new information. Not overly easy, but completely manageable if you care about the subject matter at all. ",
      "Builds on a lot of information covered in other biology courses such as Bio 110, Bio 130, or Bio 165. Coming into the course having already taken those gives you a huge head start over anyone taking this course from a different faculty or as an elective. Very detailed with organisms, but for the most part the exam was straightforward. The assignments (in the online course) were all designed to get you more interested in the microbiology field.",
      "Lots of content in this course. Exams should definitely not be in multiple choice format, it does not promote learning for this type of material. Overall it was an OK course but it could easily have been better.",
      "Know everything that is on the slides and you should be fine",
      "A pretty easy class if you take it online - no midterm just a final and 3 assignments. ",
      "interesting content, typical memorization/regurgitation course. ",
      "Easy 90 if you read the textbook along with the lecture notes. Some things you do need to memorize rather than understand - especially on midterms/final there will be questions that are very specific ",
      "It wasn't harder than any other course at the time but I just didn't find it very interesting and couldn't really relate to the topics. Did fine in the course tho, its just a basic understanding of things so future things seem a bit familiar when you hear about them again",
      "This course really helped me with my sleep deprivation. Every time I tried to study for it, my brain just couldn't comprehend the boring material and I'd wake up 1 hour later feeling as refreshed as ever from the power nap I don't remember taking. There are some folks out there who are passionate about knowing EVERY DAMN species of bacteria and their preference for oxygen, salt, heat, enzymes made etc... (seriously there is so much to know), but for the most part, I don't see why anyone would want to take this course if they weren't forced to ",
      "lots of memorisation",
      "Not very difficult midterm and final exam was incredibly easy. 90+ easily achievable, but 95+ can be tricky. I was bummed that the final exam did not specifically emphasize the mechanisms but rather throw in irrelevant nit picky questions straight from the slides that test pure memorization rather than learning concepts. Should have made the final exam harder by throwing in the mechanisms because that would have made the exam much more interesting!!! ",
      "Interesting class, not that exciting though. You do need to memorize a lot but it wasnot hard to do. whats interesting is that the proff used to post videos of the lectures on learn which made it easier to keep up with the material and learn everything from lecture and not needing to rely on the book. if you can get everything taught in the lecture you wont need the book. even though the course was only a midterm and a final, it was not hard to get a good grade",
      "Take it with Neufeld ",
      "Course is very straightforward. You don't really need to go to class if you want to get 80%. If you want that last 20%, you're going to need to go to class and absorb those minute details (i.e. Giardia causes beaver fever). Overall the class is organized and straightforward. If you've taken any other bio courses it's also easier. For example, if you've taken 309/239, the last 2 units are a joke. Good luck!",
      "This course was a breeze. Would recommend taking as an average booster if you have some background knowledge in biology, easily 80% above. You do need to stay on top of lectures otherwise the information can be a little overwhelming. Concepts are explained well in class, would suggest to read over in the textbook some of the more difficult concepts for clarification. Final marks are based off a midterm and final so make sure not to screw one of those up. ",
      "JOSH NEUFELD!\nIt's honestly hard to talk about this course without mentioning him. For this reason, I absolutely implore you to take this course as a lecture (as opposed to online); this breathes a lot of life into otherwise dry material.",
      "One of my favourite bio courses so far. Midterm was easy and Josh Neufeld is hilarious and a really good prof. There's a decent amount of memorization, not as much as some people made it seem and the content is easy.  Not hard to do well if you just memorize the slides. Its a typical bio course that doesnt require much work.",
      "Last time I've taken any biology-related course was from Science 10 which I took 6 years ago. This is the most difficult, most time demanding and driest course I've taken in university. Studied hard, thought I knew most of the stuff, but midterm was very focused on tiniest details which I was not sure of. I am taking it because I am forced to, but if I had a choice, I would never take it.",
      "Dr. Neufeld was really engaging and made the course a lot of fun. Be prepared to try to memorize some bacteria but it is all really interesting stuff. ",
      "It is a lot of memorization but it is not a bad course",
      "This was by far my favourite biology course to date! The content is very interesting, particularly for those with an interest in exploring the microbial world. The content is relatively straightforward, particularly if you've taken cell biology or genetics prior to this course. The mid-term exam and the final exam were both very fair! The content came directly from the slides and from the profs lecture, just be sure to take detailed notes. The textbook (I read each chapter) was helpful, but did not really give any advantage on the exams. Finally, Dr Neufeld is an amazing professor! He is so engaging and is truly passionate about his field. I highly recommend taking the course with him.",
      "If you have Josh Neufeld as your professor this course will surely be enjoyable. Like any biology course, a lot of memorization is required, but Neufeld provides clear explanations and many resources to help you (e.g., video animations, lots of stories to relate the material to real life, and he also audio & video records his lectures so you can re-watch any you've missed or if you need extra clarification). Don't be overwhelmed by the material, it is completely manageable. The breakdown of the course covers 10 powerpoints (~40-100 slides each) and for grades:  5% clicker participation (doesn't matter if you get it wrong or right, just counts for participation), 35% midterm exam (material test is from 5 powerpoints), and a 65% cumulative exam (material tested is from 10 powerpoints). The final exam is much easier than the midterm and an overall 80%+ in this course is very achievable. Personally, I found it most helpful to attend lecture and just listen and then rewatch the videos and take notes from that since I could understand the material at my own pace. Neufeld also uploads practice quizzes (doesn't count towards grades) to help you review material for each powerpoint. These are somewhat helpful, and most of the questions come straight from the textbook. You DO NOT need to purchase a textbook for the course. When studying for the midterm and final, MAKE SURE to review the clicker questions he has asked throughout the year (he will post them on learn), they are very representative of the level of difficulty to expect, and some of the questions are very similar or even the same as what you would see on the actual exams. Good luck! ",
      "not useful because i didnt take any additional micro courses but Neufeld was an amazing prof, must take it with him! he makes the class interesting and engaging ",
      "Neufeld keeps it engaging, otherwise it could be a dry course. Midterm was harder than exam. The course moves at an average pace (composed of 10 slideshows that are about 60-70 slides each). The annoying thing about this course was that it's only one midterm (35%) and exam (65%), with clicker taking 5% from whichever you do worse on, so if you do poorly on one it's really easy to tank your mark. That said, it's definitely possible to do very well if you stay on top of the content throughout the semester. ",
      "I took this course in Fall 2019 with Josh Neufeld (JDN). The mark breakdown of this course is as follows: 35% midterm and 65% final (multiple choice, true/false, and matching questions), plus 5% optional clicker mark that offsets a portion of either evaluation (you need to answer at least 80% of the questions to earn the full mark but it's based on participation).  The clicker questions are very representative of the questions he will ask on the midterm and final, and both evaluations are extremely fair as he only tests you on content he has covered in class. Textbook is NOT required to do well in this course. This course was a breath of fresh air after the travesty that was BIOL 130, as the midterm and exam in this course were very straightforward (very few A, B, C, A & B, A & C, all of the above, none of the above nonsense that was present in BIOL 130). JDN is my hands-down my favourite prof that I've ever had so far because he makes this (rather dry) course extremely interesting - so much that I found myself often getting up and attending the early morning lectures. He is extremely passionate about microbiology and provides the students with many different resources to help them succeed (recordings of each lecture, animations, and supplementary information for topics covered in class). JDN was also very generous on the final exam in that he removed 3 questions from the exam that he felt were too hard/worded confusingly (out of 100) despite the average below a low 70 (there was also a bonus mark!) There are 10 topics in total that are 50 - 80 slides each, accompanied with notes that give you more insight as some concepts are hard to understand if you only look at the slides or don't attend class. In order, the topic names are: Our Microbial World, Bacteria, Archaea, Eukaryotes, Viruses, Cultivation & Control, Bacterial MVPs, Regulation, Genetics, and Genomics. Even if you leave studying until the last minute, an 80+ is still easily achievable in this course. Good luck!",
      "Honestly, it was just a lot of memorization I did well in the end and I'd say the final is much easier than the midterm. I think the post-midterm stuff was easier to understand and memorize, so take your time with the pre-midterm material as it covers extensive knowledge of Bacteria, Archaea, Eukarya and Viruses.",
      "Taking this class online was a complete mistake...",
      "Took this course during the Fall 2020 term and it was completely online due to COVID.\nThe marking scheme for this course was 12 weekly quizzes where 11 out of 12 were weighed to be 100%.\nSome of the quizzes were harder than other, but they were all based off of the content modules.\nPurchased the textbook, but it was not very useful.\nThe workload is high since each quiz is 9.1%.\n",
      "Neufeld is such an amazing prof and even online you can tell that he really enjoys his work. Enjoyed the little youtube videos that he made this term as well!  Make sure to really do the reading, the select all that apply really messed me up in the quizzes but it's not hard to get a good mark in this course. Dont leave readings to the last minute though.",
      "Interesting but the pictures were nasty. Some of the weekly quizzes were pretty tough, but overall, doable (I got everywhere from high 90s to 50s). Not the easiest course I've taken but also not the hardest course I've taken. It's very much in the middle. ",
      "I did not enjoy this course online. Sounds crazy, but I would have preferred a midterm and final over the weekly quiz structure they had here. The concepts were kind of all over the place and by the end, I was wondering how what we were learning even related back to microbiology. the course kind of tricks you in the sense that the first 3-5 weeks are easy to understand and the quizzes are not difficult, but by the end, you have absolutely no idea what the hell is going on. Everybody says Neufeld is an awesome professor but there was literally no interaction with the professor online because the course consisted of long, boring readings, and no lecture videos so I don't even really know what his teaching style looks like. I would recommend you probably take this course on campus if you need to/want to take it. it is also useful for me because now I know to never take another microbio course again, lol. ",
      "I completed this course online and it was very boring. The course content was pretty much just very long articles summarising the textbook you had to read and do quizzes on. I would rather have done this course in person in a lecture hall since that would have been more engaging. The quizzes were 100% of our marks and they got quite tough near the end. Some of the quiz questions were frustrating since they tested our memory of specific things that were stated in the articles and not our understanding of the content so be careful of that.",
      "It includes a large amount of reading. Quizzes became more and more difficult. Maybe this is normal in most biol courses. ",
      "The (online) course was basically just long weekly readings that summarized the textbook. There was one quiz per week, 12 quizzes total, based on the reading you did. They start off pretty easy but quickly become very difficult. Read the weekly topic thoroughly, but don't bother buying the textbook. Overall, I didn't enjoy this course, and I think that's mostly because it was online. There was barely any interaction with the professor, aside from quick little YouTube videos he made (that I actually really liked), so I think the course would be better in person, where topics can actually be taught. No exam or midterm though, which was nice!",
      "The online version of this course is basically a waste of time and money unless you MUST take it. \nLike ok? you are just watching cheesy videos and doing eternal readings only to do a weekly quiz?",
      "TAKE THIS CLASS IN PERSON!! JDN Is amazing and is such an engaging, caring, amazing prof!! It is very easy to get high 90s if you go to class and do the practice. He makes it very fun by doing wacky demonstrations in class and telling a lot of jokes to keep students engaged,, One of the best classes I've taken in uni at this point :))))",
      "Take this course 100% with professor Neufeld! He's the best prof I have had so far in uni and I am so glad I took the course with him. His 2 midterms are VERY fair. The fairest and most straightforward exams I've written out of all my science courses. The course is basically 100% memorization for the first 2 midterms. Know the ppt's inside out and you should be perfectly fine. The content that isn't tested on the midterms but on the final is a bit understanding and application based, but all in all very doable. I didn't memorize enough for midterm 1 but I went back and made sure I memorized every ppt word per word for midterm 2 and I did great. ",
      "Great course, I didn't study much so I was getting bad grades, but I'm hoping next time I see him I can get a much better grade than now",
      "Extremely interesting course, and Dr. Neufeld is fantastic. The tests were fair and pretty easy in my opinion. I would suggest making quizlets of the key terms and examples from each main topic, so that when the midterms and final come up, you can use them to test yourself. The class went through the domains of life, several laboratory methods for studying microorganisms, viruses, and model organisms as the main topics. ",
      "All I have to say is do not take the online version with Kesen Ma",
      "The course isn't particularly difficult at any point (probably except for the last two weeks), but there is a lot of memorization, so be ready for that. ",
      "I took the course online meaning lecture reading was done almost daily and mandatory textbook readings. The quizzes cover everything and always had more than one answer (meaning correct answers subtract wrong answers). There are quizzes weekly (closed book) as well as an in-person exam at the end of the term (MC, mix and match, T/F). Friends who took the in-person class mentioned to me that they had 2 midterms and a final exam. Whether in person or online, the exam is 50% of your grade. My teacher also provided us with very little feedback and resources. Only incorrect answers were given to you after each quiz, not correct ones and no details were given about the exam other than it's a 2 1/2 hour exam in person and covers all the content learned.",
      "JDN is really good at his job. The course is enjoyable but there is a lot of content. ",
      "Relatively difficult course. I took it online and the grade breakdown was 12 quizzes worth 50% where the lowest one was dropped and only 11 of the 12 counted. The quizzes get progressively more difficult. The remaining 50% was from the final exam, no midterms. The textbook with Wiley Plus was useful for studying."

      "You basically grow a bunch of cultures on agar, week after week. It's sort of neat the first time you do it. I guess it teaches you the basics of aseptic technique etc, but I feel like that could have been incorporated into another lab. Really doesn't enhance 240 in any way, I feel like I could have gotten the same knowledge purely from lectures.",
      "Fun lab in terms of experiments, but the lab reports were pretty brutal",
      "Good lab, consistent with the course material",
      "If you have good TAs you are set. Duxbury trys to be tricky on the final and the quizes but if you do your readings before the lab you're good to go! ",
      "Honestly, the lab quizzes were straightforward as long as you read your lab material prior to the lab. But the lab quizzes are given randomly, so it's best to just look over it every week. Final exam was super easy, spent an hour studying for it, pulled above an 80 in the course.",
      "Honestly, the lab component was mostly just swabbing stuff, giving it to the TAs to be incubated, and then coming back next week to check the results and then swabbing more stuff. But in fairness, you do learn the fundamentals of microbiology lab work, like aseptic technique, various dilution techniques, and proper inoculation methods. \n\nYou learn some interesting things if you care to study for the lab quizzes. But the incentive to study is not that high because the lab quizzes are notoriously difficult, can test minuet details in the manual, and are spontaneous. ",
      "this really depends on your TA, but I did pretty well at the end. ",
      "Awful course, I highly recommend that you do not take it unless it is absolutely necessary. Weekly pop quizzes were pretty tough, and the marks took forever to be released and were often incorrect on LEARN. The prof for this course was not much help, and the lab manual was full of mistakes that made some labs very confusing. ",
      "If you plan on going into microbiology, this lab is great. For me though, a waste of time. The experiments were repetitive and basically showed you information you could have gotten online. The lab reports didn't make any sense but luckily were not worth much.",
      "Not particularly hard, as long as you look over your experiments beforehand and can get a decent lab partner. Lets you carry out some interesting microbiology experiments.",
      "Such an easy laboratory while learning really transferable skills",
      "I didn't find it supplemented my learning of BIO 240. The labs were kind of pointless since you knew what the outcome would be. The reports were pretty easy but the final was brutal.",
      "The Lab Exam is extremely HARD and random!",
      "Not sure why people hate on this lab. It teaches you basic fundamentals to microbiology labs and all the answers to the quizzes are in the manual without any tricks. Thought it was enjoyable and had fun writing the lab reports all though, they should be worth more as it is only 15% total for 2 labs",
      "its just your typical lab with occassional quizes but my ta's were super strick on spelling like you can't put E.coli you have to put Escherichia coli.... but it wasn't hard but didn't really find an application for what I learned yet. Its just a very basic understanding of things but the lab was fun",
      "This lab is great if you are passionate about swabbing E.Coli every week for 3 hours. The weekly quizzes are wonderful in the sense that they ask you the most pointless questions like ''what dye is used in the spore stain'', and you'd reply with ''malachite green'' but because you didn't list the percentage of the dye, you only get half a mark  (and the quiz is only out of 10 marks to begin with). You even  have to know how to spell all the names of the bacteria used (full names) correctly or you don't get a mark . You don't even really need to take the 240 course with it, as the lab has almost nothing to do with any of the content. I have yet to do the final, but I heard it is brutal (even the quizzes were brutal). If you love to occupy yourself for 8 hours writing lab reports on experiments you barely understand when you have midterms going on,  then this is the course for you ",
      "loved it",
      "This course is so frustrating. It's a 3h block but you MIGHT spend 2h there. You just slap microbe cultures on jello and then leave and wait for it to grow. Stupid and should be replaced by a tutorial where you observe prepared plates, as it takes too much time for the actual techniques learned",
      "There were some labs that were incredibly boring, however, there were some that were incredibly fun and interesting. Similar to BIOL 130L, completely run by TAs, which can be good for you, or can put you at a disadvantage. Exam was harder than expected (that being said, it wasn't a very difficult exam).",
      "Read procedures beforehand, come optimistic, don't let the huge lab manual scare you.",
      "The spontaneous lab quizzes always keep you on your toes (plus they were mostly cumulative which sucked) and I found that the lab reports were tricky to do well on. There was a lab exam when I took it in Fall 2017 which wasn't crazy hard, similar in nature to other lab exams I've had for biology courses. Overall, the course seemed to be helpful in developing essential lab skills, specifically in aseptic technique.",
      "This lab was super simple but takes up the entire 3 hours usually. It's a weekly lab with random pop quizzes out of 10 (usually pretty simple single word concepts). There were two lab reports and random book completion checks. Lab reports were easy to get perfect on if you follow the instructions provided. It's a good idea to come prepared for the lab period each week since you will be doing multiple experiments and recording results from previous ones each time (this can be time consuming if not prepared). Final exam was easy though, 55 multiple choice questions very similar to quizzes. ",
      "labs are not too bad but the final will bite u in the ass",
      "I had a horrible TA and the lab exam was like not great but I managed to pull through. The lab and lab reports themselves were really easy to do well on. The annoying thing were the 5 quizzes on the experiments which were cumulative in the content that could appear on it.",
      "There were two lab reports, random flow chart checks and quizzes, and a final. I found the lab to be fun and more relaxing. It was also easy since a lot of the labs are repetitive with bacterial swabbing and such. The final wasn't too bad if you reviewed the lab manual. The only thing that was annoying was MC that contained choices like A and B, all of the above, none of the above for many of the questions.",
      "pick a good partner",
      "Took this course during the Fall 2020 during the COVID 19 crisis so there was both an in-person and remote. There were only 5 in-person labs each 3 hours long throughout the term. There is more dry-lab or remote lab work to complete\nThe marking scheme was 10% participation marks, 12% quizzes (best 5 out of 6), 20% (2 lab reports), 3% flowchart check, 10% lab manual check and 45% final exam.\nThis course was actually pretty hard. I got a low 80. There was so much dry lab work and problems to do from it. Were not given the answers to most of the dry lab questions when studying for the final exam. Never got participation marks when getting my final mark. \nThe final exam was quite tricky questions similar to those from BIOL 130 (A or B, C or D, All of the above) and the its average was like a 75%.\nThe final probably brought me down 10% closer to the class average of 77% (the highest class average so far!)",
      "Useful course but the grading scheme for the lab reports was pretty harsh. Lab exam was a breeze even when it was closed book, I only studied the morning I was planning on writing it and passed with what I believe was an 85, but it could've been curved up. If you were focused when reading the manual it won't be too hard for you. Cite every line in your reports. Every. Single. Line. ",
      "A lot of fun and easy to do well. Study for the quizzes because they are written answer; they aren't that hard but you need to actually know the theory and steps of the labs. Exam was actually difficult but multiple choice.",
      "The worst course I've taken by a long shot. Awful marking scheme with a massive importance on the terrible final exam. Hope that your TA's are nice to you because they really make or break the experience.  Dr Duxbury is not cooperative at all. This is a sharp contrast to the phenomenal Biol 240 course.",
      "Great course as an intro to microbiology practices in terms of learning techniques, but the marking scheme makes no sense at all. 2 lab reports worth 20% total, cumulative lab quizzes requiring manual memorization and an impossible 45% exam. Not to mention the professor was rude and unprofessional, often giving students zero wiggle room while emailing from her phone with plenty of spelling mistakes. No clue how I passed this course.",
      "I have mixed feelings about this course, but I suppose it was more fun than it was annoying. First of all, make sure you're always on point with deadlines and lab protocol, because if not you'll have to answer to Cheryl Duxbury (yikes). Secondly, your TAs will be the ones teaching the course, so don't get on their bad side as well. The labs were fun but the final exam was absolutely unnecessary and brutal.",
      "Your experience will probably depend on your TA, but the course was pretty fun. You'll probably finish most labs early and the lab reports aren't bad coming from a math student. Exam was pretty tricky, but personally found it to be not as bad as the reviews make it seem.",
      "This course is an exercise in two things: memorization and application. Like first year labs, the procedure for every experiment is clearly laid out and you are supplied with enough material beforehand. Read the pre-lab modules, and watch any videos that are posted. Also look up JoVE (Journal of Video Education) videos beforehand for any other experiment if you need the procedure cleared. You are expected to make flowcharts for each experiment. Try your best to participate in pre-lab talks. There are multiple experiments in each lab session; if you have prepared well, each should take around ~30 min or less. Lab quizzes occur unannounced and count for a lot, relatively speaking. They are cumulative--so keep reviewing your material throughout the term. Highly recommend making flash cards of expected results, procedures, and reagents. Sometimes expected results are posted, sometimes they are shown in the lab on the board. Always write them down in your manual, no matter what. Lab report for labs change from term-to-term, but you only get a week to do them. Get started immediately; research usually takes the longest. Write detailed outlines to make report writing easier. The lab manual and report expectations for each report (should be 2 reports in the term) are very clear about what is to be required, so follow them. The final exam is notorious for being difficult or impossible, but this does not have to be the case. Above all, it is a test of how confident you are in your knowledge. Review procedures, theory behind those procedures, and what your results would end up as if you missed/made a mistake in a step. ANYTHING that is written in the lab manual, in the pre-lab modules, or discussed about in pre-lab talks is fair game for the test. You are expected to know all of it (so memorize, make flash cards throughout the term so you aren't cramming before the end). TAs are often knowledgeable and can answer any questions you may have. TL;DR: come prepared, stay prepared, and prepare for the future. Good luck!"

DO NOT TAKE THIS COURSE UNLESS YOU HAVE TO, AND EVEN IF YOU DO, CONSIDER SWITCHING PROGRAMS (it's seriously that bad).",
      "Contrary to what everyone says, I found that her exams are actually pretty fair in general and most of the questions are lifted from her power point slides. \n\nStudy those well, keep up with the material, and it should be a decent course. The real difficulty is staying awake in class, lol. ",
      "Easy, straightforward course that relies almost solely on memorization.",
      "I'm not a fan of Duxbury's labs, but they're straightforward. Honestly, a lot of the lab component is review from 240L. The class itself was great - I'm not very interested in the carbon and nitrogen cycles, but Pinheiro was engaging enough that I still found the class to be really enjoyable. There's also a unit or two on waste management and water treatment - it was nice to get away from pure science for a bit and see the broad applications of what we're learning.",
      "Barbara Butler made this course quite boring. I found it hard to concentrate and stay awake. The lab was tedious and lab reports were long although they were only worth 3 and 6 %.  Course is pretty easy if it weren't for the boring content.  I wouldn't recommend this course unless you actually like microbiology. ",
      "Pinheiro is such a sweetheart! Great prof, fair tests and the content is great if you like a broad range of topics in microbio.",
      "not an easy course due to the lab component. i loved the course material and did really good in the course, but the lab brought my mark down alot",
      "course was very dry and if you've taken previous bio courses like 130, 273 and 239 there are repeating concepts. ",
      "Pretty easy course; lots of memorization. I found the material to be pretty interesting but most would probably find it boring. Write down everything she says because her midterm/exam questions are not based solely on her powerpoints.  ",
      "I can see the usefulness of BIOL 241, as it does go over a lot of lab techniques and commercial uses of microbiology. However, for someone not interested in microbiology lab work this course is very boring. ",
      "This course is fine. More of 240, so if you liked that you'll like this.",
      "This  class is so boring... Worst professor I've had to date :(",
      "This course was more practical than BIOL 240, there was a lot less memorization involved which was also nice. Butler had everything laid out nicely on her slides and did not ask trick questions. Since the lab was incorporated into the marking scheme of the lecture, the midterm and final for this course were not as heavily weighted. The lab was also quite easy, somehow the TAs marked the lab reports harder than they did in BIOL 240L so make sure you email them frequently to know exactly what they want or they'll butcher you",
      "great course like biol 240 but different perspective almost. Follow every single point the lab rubric is asking for. if you think of your report: \"its too detailed and too in depth\" then youve got an 80 minimum. if you think \"do i really have to include that? i wont include it\" youve got a <60. email the TAs as much as you can do it early as possible. the lab exam is a mess so keep a good course mark",
      "Took this is pandemic 2021 Winter. Content-wise, this was more environmentally oriented. I found it fun and refreshing but kinda unrelated to what I want to do. The last few units are about immunology and health oriented microorganisms but we didn't get there before the end of the term and apparently no one ever does.",
      "i really liked biol 240 so i was a bit disappointed in this course since it's a bit boring in comparison. it's a fair course tho. the lab component helped my final grade which I guess is surprising but I've always done better on lab reports in comparison to tests. finished with a 88",
      "Much easier than Biol 240. I think the breakdown was like 30% Lab which consisted of like a 50% Lab final, and other lab stuff (quizzes, lab reports). 25% midterm and 45% final? I can't remember. Though the content was much easier to memorize and was more straightforward than the Biol 240. The lecture component is easy, but what would brought my mark down was the lab component which should've been easy but I ended up in a section where the TA marked hella hard so it's kinda up to luck.",
      "This course was the lecture component and the lab component combined into one. The lab component (worth 30% of the final grade) is pretty alright. The lecture component (worth 70%) literally compromised of uploaded lecture videos/pdfs, a 35% midterm and a 35% final. I didn't appreciation paying the cost of tuition for this.",
      "I was required to take this course for my program, but it felt pretty unnecessary to be honest. The content is very boring but not hard to understand, and the exams weren't bad (35% midterm and 35% final). If you enjoyed the content in biol 240 you'll probably like this course, since its basically a regurgitation of biol 240 with a viewpoint of environmental applications. The lab component (30%) felt pretty disorganized, and a lot of the labs we had to rush to get the experiments done within the 3 hours. The lab reports were marked similarly to biol 240L (pretty harsh), but make sure you have extremely detailed discussions that address every single result to get a decent mark. The lab exam was rough but its only worth 13.5% of your overall grade. Overall pretty boring but not that time consuming. ",
      "I hate microbes. But it's useful information and I feel like everyone should take this course. It might seem like common sense, but microbes are everywhere and so it's good to know. This course wasn't hard but I put close to no effort into it because it's mildly triggering for me. If you half ass it you can probably get a 75, put in a bit of effort and you can get an 80.",
      "Annoying course, the exam steamrolled us. From what I understand, Cheryl wrote the exam but didn't teach us, another lecturer did. Your classic bio questions with a,b,c,a&b, b&C, all the above and all the options could be true but there is this tiny nuance that you are supposed to pick up on. Regardless, if you need to take it, just get thru the content and really focus up on the exam, you should be fine.",
      "Horrible and pointless class. It's just a repeat of 240 with a worse professor.",
      "This was a fun course with a nice extension of knowledge from BIOL240. Some found it \"useless\", but in my opinion, it's great to know a little more about what microbes are used for/do in the real world and not just learn about their structure or names (for the lecture component at least).\n\nThe only thing I could point out for improvement in the future is having more strict evaluation of the TAs that are in charge of lab grades. Some of them were very biased and unprofessional. ",
      "The content in this course is less difficult than BIOL 240 - you don't have to memorize any specific phylum or clades and the organisms in them along with their characteristics etc. It builds on some concepts that you learn in 240 with an emphasis on environmental and industrial applications to microbiology. However, because the content is (subjectively) not difficult, the midterm and final are \"application\" based which makes this course hard for no reason at all. Typical \"a, b, c, b&c, all of the above\" multiple choice where all the options are extremely vague and you could argue any of the options are the correct answer. The lab is painful and unorganized as usual, but the lab reports were less stressful and easier than the ones for 240L in my opinion. Be prepared for having two finals as well... there is a lab final and a lecture final. Overall, the lecture doesn't require a large time commitment but the lab does; its not the easiest course but definitely still possible to get an 80%+."

      "very straight forward course theres nothing to really get confused about but really honestly truly do everything you can early so you can ask questions cuz it can make the difference between a 60 or a 100 on a lab. not totally easy if youre not particularly math or computers inclined",
      "i enjoyed this course quite a bit. it's weird cuz for the majority of it, it doesn't even really feel like a bio course more like a weird \"learning about computer programs\" and \"fancy computerized trees\" course. Dr Doxey is a really great prof and gives hints about what will be in midterm/final throughout his lectures, and the course content is really not that difficult to understand since he goes through all of the concepts in lots of detail- just remember to ask questions if you're confused. \nIn terms of the lab- i kept getting 70's and 60's cuz the labs were only out of 3 or 4 marks so my advice is to check over your answers multiple times and ask questions if you're not sure cuz fixing that one mistake can take you from a 70 to a 100. all in all, i would recommend this course. definitely better than a lot of other BIOL200 courses that I've taken. ",
      "This is a bird course in terms of workload. Labs were an easy 100 if you do them early and show up to office hours to ask any questions you have. However, you have to really study for the midterm and final (for 90+) since there are a couple of questions that ask for specific information from the slides that you just have to memorize. Average for the midterm (Fall 2021) was low 70s iirc.",
      "Took the course online during COVID. 20% labs, 25% midterm, and 55% final.  The labs were pretty straightforward, and enough instructions were posted that it's possible to get 100% on all of them. The midterm and final were also pretty straightforward, as long as you watch and review all of the lecture slides. \n\nThe material itself was sort of basic. The course covers a lot of databases and some basic computational methods. In my opinion, you don't learn enough to be able to start using this stuff in your job after completing the course, but it's a good intro course and good for the GPA too. ",
      "Many people often say that this course is a bird course. However, I did not find that to be the case. This course was a lot harder than I had expected it to be. The grade breakdown was as follows, 20% lab assignments, 30% midterm, 50% final exam. Even though the TA (Benjamin Jenkins) said that the lab assignments are meant to be straightforward, some of them were still very tricky. Additionally, it was very frustrating that the lab assignments were administered as multiple choice learn quizzes. As a result, there was no opportunity to receive part-marks for explaining your thought process or was there any opportunity to show your work. The midterm and the final were challenging for the following reasons. The calculation based questions were quite time consuming. It almost felt like there was only a minute given for each question. This course is not a bird course. Please take that into consideration. It can be a lot harder than what others make of it to be. ",
      "Pretty interesting course! As a CS major it was cool to see some programming and statistics concepts being used in another field. Not very related to BIOL 130 at all. Midterm and exams were both online and straightforward. And the weekly labs/assignments were easy 100s if you start early/ask for clarifications."

      "This course made me want to cry in tears how much time I committed to memorize Vivian's 150 page bible. Easy 90+ if you want to memorize her course notes and read her textbook. Wanted to puke in misery when I memorized every single page of those course notes. Very interesting however if you love human physiology. ",
      "The information is interesting but Vivian is such a tricky exam writter. It really makes you feel terrible. She pulls info from the textbook NEVER discussed in class and puts it on the exam. She told us that the final would be like 80% info from after the midterm but it was more like 60%. The information is definitely useful and interesting and you need it for BIOL 373 (taught by Heidi so will hopefully be better). Necessary course, but I just didn't like the prof's style.",
      "Great class, only complaint would be about the quizzes. At the end of every unit students must complete a 15 question quiz in 20 minutes. They are manageable to do well on but rather stressful. There are also optional assignments which are easy and definite grade boosters (I had a 95% average on these assignments). The midterm was a breeze, but the exam was killer (and likely bell-curved since the final mark did not reflect the struggle). I highly recommend this course, especially with Dayeh. ",
      "I took this course online and thought it was easy throughout the term. There were quizzes for each unit and they weren't challenging as long as you had listened to the lectures. However,  do not leave studying for the final until last minute, there are so many processes and concepts to remember. Not a memorization course, but definitely doable if you keep on top of it. ",

However, the Pearson online textbook learning was a really helpful study tool. I would recommend doing the optional assignments, they saved my grade. The weekly review sessions were also good to help review concepts that were hard to get in the lecture.",
      "I did this course online, and I found it extremely interesting. I really like the course material. However, since it was all online, I learned predominantly from reading all the lengthy textbook chapters. As long as you stay on top of your work, you should do well in this course. The end of unit quizzes are a little stressful since they're timed, but they're still manageable.",
      "so content heavy so incredibly content heavy. i recommend in course over online. otherwise very interesting",
      "Took this course during the Fall 2020 term so it was completely remote due to COVID 19. This course was not hard. The marking scheme was 25% midterm, 10% quizzes (5 2% each), 15% mastering AP assignments (directly from the textbook so easy marks), 5% DSM assignments (free marks), and 40% final exam.\nThe textbook is required for this course and it has to be the version the instructor asks you to use. Without a textbook you would not be able to do the DSM and Mastering AP assignments. The midterm and final were fair. Most of the questions on the final and midterm were from the course notes like around 90% while 10% were from the assigned readings from the textbook. \nThe final exam was very similar to the practice final she provided.\nFinished with a high 80.",
      "Definitely a hard course but so interesting and useful. Textbook and course notes are expensive but mandatory so make sure you get them both before classes start. Final was extremely hard and specific but you are given a practice test so that helped.

Basically mandatory for any science or health career so take your time with it!",
      "Not useful for me considering my specialization is biotech and I focus more on microorganisms, but still a lovely course to take! Lots of info to take in but if you were paying attention it the lectures and really did those Mastering AP questions well, you'll be fine! ",
      "Took this course online and I really enjoyed learning the content. I don't consider myself stellar at biology, but I did find the course overall was pretty fair in terms of marking and the tests. I recommend finding Quizlet/flashcard sets for terms and cycles ASAP so you can practice early since there is a lot of content that is covered. You don't necessarily need the textbook and/or course-notes to pass, but it can be helpful in understanding the concepts and save time in note-taking.",
      "I say it is useful ONLY if you continue to pursue something medical or in a health profession. If not please skip this course (unless you really like anatomy) because it goes very in-depth into a lot of stuff and leaves you confused. I personally loved this course it was a challenge but it was nice learning the content did not mind I was up until 3am doing so. Here are some tip. \n\n1. the course is not easy. A big reason is that it's very textbook-heavy! I had Vivian and she uses a lot of info from the textbook into the test and final as well as a lot of application questions. I highly doubt anyone would pass this course without the textbook. luckily it's free online. \n2. What I wish I had known was to do the homework questions provided in the textbook after every chapter before attempting her quizzes, midterms and tests. She really does base her questions off of them, sometimes they are the exact same questions. I did them last minute before taking the final and not even kidding some of them were exactly the same. Again this is not the only thing you should rely on. A lot of her questions are application based and you really need to grasp the concept to answer those. \n3. The information in this course can get overwhelming with the number of pages from the textbook to read. I recommend reading at least 6-7 pages after watching every individual lecture that way you do not cram 300 pages before a midterm or final. Plus 20% of your mark is doing assignments from the textbook so dividing your readings like this will really be useful for that.\n",
      "goes in depth so make sure you're actually interested in the content! Also try to stay on top of notes because its rly hard to cram/last minute study for this course ",
      "Very content heavy, definitely recommend taking it over the summer or during a semester with less of a course load. The textbook is a must, you definitely need it but you can probably find one for free online. There are also a lot of quizlets online that are very helpful.",
      "Relatively easy course. Most of it is memorization, but less so than BIOL 201.  The lecture notes, when complete, will be enough to prepare for the exam. ",
      "This was a very interesting course. There's plenty of memorization that's required but once you get the core concepts down it's easy to understand what's going on intuitively. It's not an anatomy course so you won't be hard memorizing bones or anything. You're focusing more on the processes and cool stuff that makes our bodies work. Very good foundational course for future studies.",
      "I found this course both taught in a much better way and much more enjoyable to learn than BIOL 130. Lectures were always presented live and had a well-produced video if you were unable to attend the class live or the instructor couldn't make the class. Prof. Dayeh was always welcome to questions during and after class, however, this sometimes meant the material during class got a little cramped. There is definitely a lot of content covered in each lecture but the testable material is fair and thoroughly enjoyable if you have an interest in the different body/organ systems.",
      "LOVED THIS COURSE. The content is really interesting and consequently the lectures are interesting. I would highly recommend attending in person because you are actually able to pay attention when you're there, whereas if you're just watching a screen recording, you automatically stop paying attention. Dr Dayeh knows what she's doing and she's very competent (and I wish she taught human phys II, iykyk). Our course consisted of 3 25% tests and some assignments. There's a lot of content to memorize, but space it out and understand it, and you'll probably be fine. Although there are quite a few application questions on the tests, so you really have to grasp the content well. But it's interesting, so it's enjoyable. Hardest unit was probably the immune system, just cause you don't really know anything about it coming in. ",
      "For this course, as long as you attend classes and study, you should do pretty well. The test questions were pretty straightforward/ not tricky yet you definitely needed to study to get the answers right. At the beginning of the term I was hearing from upper year students that the midterm questions were heavily based off the textbook content though that was thankfully false and majority of the questions you'd know the answer if you studied the course notes. The textbook is more important for the A & P assignments and I'd still recommend reading the textbook for things you may be confused about as it explains things more in depth. For my class our lectures took place in an auditorium in haggey hall which made it really hard for me to pay attention and not fall asleep as there weren't even tables or desks just cushiony chairs. Tjis caused me to stop attending the classes as when I did attend I spent the whole time trying to keep my eyes open. She posted online lectures and i told myself I'd watch those instead but I just ended up falling very behind and trying to study all the tested course material the day before the exam. I would not recommend this. I recommend doing your best to attend class even if it's hard to stay awake because it'll be harder to get yourself to watch the lecture online later. If you like to rewrite your notes, there will be a lot of notes to write so I'd recommend writing your notes after each class/ on the same day of the class so that the amount of notes you need to write doesn't become overwhelming. The prof was very nice and even gave us 3 bonus questions on the final midterm which I was so grateful for.",
      "useful, interesting content, had to study a moderate amount, just wish we had a lecture hall rather then a theatre for a classroom I would like a table pls",
      "This course has so much foundational content for upper-year courses in like the faculty of health, so you're set for those if you make good notes in this course. Also, there was no exam, just 3 non-cumulative midterms that were extremely fair and pretty straightforward if you paid attention to what was emphasized in class. Just make sure to do all of the e-textbook stuff because it's actually a big chunk of your mark lol"

The lab reports were really straight forward and if you've taken any other bio lab, then you should have no problem getting at least an 80 on the reports. There's a quiz associated with each experiment but the 5 or 6 questions they choose from are given to you ahead of time so you can go in knowing what the answers are (those quizzes are free marks so take them). The final wasn't too difficult but it's short so make sure you review your labs well (all aspects) that way you can score high. ",

      "Great 300 level course if you enjoy learning about anatomy.  Has 1 midterm, lab quizzes (really simple, similar to BIOL 110), and a final. Midterm and final were all multiple choice.  Questions were straightforward, majority coming from the course notes, and a small portion from the textbook. Lots of memorization involved, but that's to be expected considering it's an anatomy course. ",
      "There is a lot of content in this course, but if you're good at straight memorization then you'll be fine. The lab quizzes are quite easy if you study a little for them, and the midterm was very fair. Overall its a time consuming course but you can get 90+ if you're willing to put the time/effort in. ",
      "Weekly labs with quizzes are pretty annoying. You have to study at least an hour or two every week for the lab quizzes where you dissect a cat in a course called human anatomy. There is no textbook and course notes are scattered and disorganized.  Just a pure memorization course. ",
      "The concepts of this course were simple but it was pure memorization. Vivian is a b**** when it comes to spelling for her fill in the blank sections on the midterm and the final. If you buy into the mastering anatomy and do the 5 super simple quizzes you can get 5% of your final grade guaranteed. There was also a super short assignment involved easy to get 100 on. Midterm wasn't hard material, just a lot remember and SPELLING!!!\nThe lab component was easy and short, never there for the full time. Easy dissections and the lab final/mini quizzes are good practice for getting acquainted with some of the terms before the class final.\nClass final consisted of 120marks, multiple choice and fill in the blank, the concepts aren't hard, just give yourself a few days to really memorize the material and you'll get an 80+ in the course no problem. (ps mnemonics help).",
      "It was purely a lot of memorization on top of many courses I had to take during this term but the class was interesting with a super easy mid term but a harder final exam. All the material that was included in the test and the exam were fair material right out of her course notes and if you really have her notes memorized and a gist of all the diagrams provided, you can easily get an 80+ in this course. The lab was super interesting, and the quizzes were fairly easy as they only required you to study parts of your dissections during the lab itself (except the first two labs). And the lab exam was pretty fair of the things learnt in lab and the dissections which was worth 15% of the entire course! Overall, it is a good course, but wouldn't recommend if you're taking other courses which require a lot of memorization along with it! ",
      "This is definitely a useful course to take!!! You will have to put in an effort for a good grade, but besides the final exam the course is not stressful. The labs were actually enjoyable, with oral quizzes at the end of each. This term mice, a cow eye, and sheep organs (e.g. heart) were dissected. Doing the MAP assignments option is recommended for a free 5%. ",

      "Stay away from this course like the plague, but all life science students should sit in on the lectures. The content is almost totally useless insofar as practicality, and the prof makes little effort to make it easier - as mentioned by another commenter, Dr. Marsden's slides don't do a very good job outlining what we actually need to know, especially because there is a lot to know/be able to identify. Don't get too discouraged by the first midterm. The lab I found rather useless. All in all, avoid this course is possible - it's cool finally seeing in more detail how cells make up tissues, but there are better ways to do so then this course. A GPA buster, for sure. ",
      "If you're taking this course solely for the purpose of it being an exemption when you get to optometry (like I did) than AVOID THIS COURSE. Histology in optom is only 2 hours a week and there is no lab (everyone did really well in the course). 302 was way harder than it needed to be, and will definitely pull your GPA down. It's all visual learning and being able to memorize pictures. Think carefully before taking this course - it's challenging to do well in it, so only take it if you absolutely need to. \n",
      "Half of the crap in this course (depending on what you're planning on doing with your degree) is useless. It can be very difficult especially near the end of the course to differentiate between different structures. The lecture is very helpful since Mungo will circle areas in class. Definitely do a lot of practice to do well on the exams, I would not suggest studying only the night before and expecting to get a 90. But the class is easy if you prepare yourself accordingly. The lab is brutal and a waste of time though since most of the TAs are dumb as hell. I really hope they turn the labs into optional tutorials or clicker questions for future classes since that was usually a waste of an hour of my day",
      "This course makes all the other science courses you'll take so much easier. You finally get to see all the different cells or layers of tissue that you've been learning about. Definitely recommend this course. The labs are very helpful at reaffirming the information. Definitely need to study and know the material well but with some work you can get a very good grade.",
      "I don't get why people below say that this course is a \"GPA buster\". Professor Marsden does an excellent job going through the basic tissues and then the organ systems, and gives you the basic tools to analyze micrographs. It is up to you to then take it further and find more pictures online to really test yourself. I found that exposing myself to a lot of pictures and making my own questions was the best thing to do to succeed in this course with an easy 95+.",

In the end, it's a party trick like \"oooooh, give me a picture and I can guess the tissue type\"",

Just use Biolucida to study, look at images from other sources, ask questions and you will do just fine. \nThe lab is also so much fun."

I feel like if that is what was expected of us to learn than the prof. should have spent more time on those parts. \nThe material comes hard and fast, with little time for explanation.  This course wasn't one I enjoyed, even though I love Molecular Biology. If you can choose not to take this course, I would not take this course.",
      "Great course, I hate how much fundamental filler crap you have to get through before you learn anything really interesting. If you're into molecular biology there some incredible insights into splicing and transcriptional mechanisms i found fascinating. You're evaluated on your ability to finish the study question or your ability to amass a library or them and regurgitate them on the exam. There is a lot of material despite have a clear set of question to focus you brain on the important stuff. Its definitely a course you need a few days to let the material sink in before the exam. ",
      "Know your stuff, take with Dr. Wolff, he is great! \nGo to class, memorize everything, regurgitate it back...easy 80",
      "On the first day of lectures Dr. Miskovic told the class that there were study questions, and to do them. The study questions are the only content you need. Do not make notes as you would traditionally for a course, exclusively focus on the content covered in those questions. You also start them immediately after the content was covered in lecture, and review them frequently - as Dr. Miskovic will tell you, they comprise 70% of the questions on examinations. Do NOT leave them until the end, or there's a good chance you'll fail the course. Finally, do the practice final multiple times as well.",
      "So, this course was not difficult. The content all made sense; however there's a butt load of it and more than half of it she will never ask you on the final. As mentioned by other people, don't make notes beyond what you took in class, just answer the study questions (some of the questions are identical) and DO the study questions as you go, there's so many of them it's overwhelming to cram. Also, if there isn't a facebook group for the class then make one, you're all struggling throughout it and it will workout better for everyone to get clarification. The bonus marks are a blessing, not just on the tests but from going to her office hours and also doing some origami for her. She talks super fast, so if you're taking notes by hand, read over the material ahead of time, otherwise type. The quizzes are a gimme, and the final has a ridiculous amount of repeat questions from the practice one. The course is easy if you approach it like she tells you to.",
      "Worst course ever. I took it with Dragana and it was really bad even with the study questions she provided us with.  However, only 7 people failed the course when I took it (not accounting for the people who dropped the course half way through) and I think she curved the final marks which is a good thing! ",
      "I don't understand why this course is mandatory. There is information equivalent to 3 courses, with the professor not being approachable or articulate in what she is teaching. She read off the slides and hardly explained anything. The content was not necessary. There were small details that seemed more important than the bigger picture. A lot of the topics went into details about the wrong things like which protein is activated for how many bp. Does anyone care? She tested 15 lectures for a 25% midterm and if you ask her questions she stares at you like you're dumb. DO NOT TAKE IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO. You can't memorize nor can you understand because nothing is explained. If you do have to take it, good luck! ",
      "An extremely overloaded, poorly structured and overall difficult course. If you are required to take it, brace yourself - it won't be easy.",
      "Mandatory class for me. Definitely not easy, but useful for other classes. Theres a bunch of free marks for submitting MCQs with the BASS group which was fun in the first few weeks, but after study week there's less time for this and the group meetings were pretty brief. \n\nTip: Make sure you do the study questions (they will 100% be on the tests)!! \n",
      "i did not understand this course i did but i also didnt. the powerpoints were honestly horrible like a dumpster fire of text boxes on each slide if you rely on organized visual aids im sorry. however theres plenty of opportunities to get marks and the exams are actually quite fair just so much information it can be overwhelming",
      "Took this course Spring 2021 completly online due to COVID. The marking scheme was 50 Quizzes (5 x 10%) and 50% Midterms (2 x 25%). There is a lot of content that is covered, but the content itself is not very hard. The hardest part about this course is the time crunch on quizzes and midterms. The quizzes are 20 questions in 20 minutes and some of the questions are from material already quizzed on. The midterms are completely long answer so you are given a test box to write out your responses. The midterm questions are fair and similar to the ones in the midterm review set. Don't why Dr. Wolff gets a lot of hate. Everytime I emailed about questions on a quiz not being fair, he immeditately responsed and adjusted my mark when appropirate. He even offered a 2% bonus mark for surveys and the midterms out of 50 marks had a 5 mark bonus question. Overall, 80+ is possible if you do all the practice questions on the practice midterm set.",
      "I heard that Dragana was a really good prof for this course but honestly there was so much content for a single course. I don't know why but since COVID required online lectures, Dragana seemed to think that we had all the time in the world for her class, with like 3-4 hours of lectures each week, even with the study questions her marking scheme is really hard when it comes to the written response. I don't know how it'll be on campus but she made it necessarily hard with covid. Prof also kinda thinks everyone is dumb?? Like someone complained about being unfair and she copy and pasted the email, and went on about how she's the 'fairest' professor you would ever get. Break down wasn't too bad, 60% Midterms (3 midterms 20% each), 20% Notetonic (Kinda like a weekly quiz), and 20% Group work. The scheduling of her midterms was dumb like Midterm 2 and 3 were literally a week apart, made no sense at all.",
      "Before I took this course I was told over half the content mentioned in the lectures wont be on the midterms, that didnt make sense to me. But I realized its because this course covers so much material that it cant even fit into 3 midterms. There's like 3 courses worth of content in this class. Managed to finish with a high 70 after getting a 57 on the second midterm. A lot of bonus marks are given and easy marks for noteonics + BAAS. Im sure the midterms will not be as difficult in person so studying and grinding the content out will be more effective as the midterms online were all open book.",
      "Course hard as heck but cool as heck too so its chill. ",
      "i liked this course but just know you need to put in a LOT of effort to do well. MAKE SURE YOU DO THE STUDY QUESTIONS BECAUSE THEY WILL BE ON THE TESTS. the sheer amount of content is very overwhelming but the tests are very fairly structured with a mix of easy multiple choice and some short answer questions. i scored poorly on the tests (58 on the first test and 69 on the second) but there are lots of opportunities to make up for your test mark with other assessments. notetonics and BASS were my saving grace (also don't worry about the group work, it is structured so that there are no freeloaders). haven't received my final mark yet but from my calculations, I think I got an 80.",
      "Tough class. Not necessarily difficult material, but it's just so much to remember in such a small amount of time. The prof does give a lot of free marks, but she's also very arrogant about it. You can't skip the lectures, but I don't think I used the textbook at all. Do not leave studying to the last minute.",
      "if someone put a trigger to my head and asked me just ONE THING I learned in this course, I would probably be dead. I still don't know how I passed. I think I actually got a 70 and I'd say that's a bloody miracle. So I guess what I'm trying to say is that it's not impossible, but I must admit, at a certain point in time I was so doomed I stopped studying for the exam because I figured no amount of studying was going to help me. It's probably not a useless or impossible course but it's just not worth the decline in mental health (for me at least, since I value my mental health).",
      "I stopped showing up to the lectures and my performance actually improved. His lectures are crammed with information and he is SO boring to listen to, I stopped showing up when he started to explain the lac operon wrong... you're probably better off going through the slideshows on your own and using the textbook to supplement your understanding (if you know you have the self-motivation). The exams were difficult but if you do the study questions you'll be good for the short answers. Don't recommend taking this course if you don't need it (especially at the same time as biol 303), it will probably bring down your average. Being successful in this course is possible (I finished with a 90) but you'll feel like you're struggling the entire time. ",
      "Im going to try and stay away from making statements like I hate this course and give you useful information.\n\nThe course is filled with a MASSIVE amount of information that it is not possible to remember. I recommend going to lectures but keep in mind I would end up sleeping through half of it. The slides are filled with so much information too. It is a pipe dream to expect to remember all of that.\n\nSo what to do? Try and go thru the slides, really skim and and pick out core topics and concepts that seem testable and absorb that (you have to use your discretion and common sense, if you were the examiner, what would you test). Really do this exercise, it helps get rid of all the other filler garbage info (plenty of that believe me). The study questions or whatever are really great for this. If you can master them, you should be good. ",
      "(Spring '23 edit) Without a doubt the hardest bio course I've taken thus far as I'm finishing 3B.  I actually had to retake this course after failing with Bruce Reed. Wolff is definitely a LOT better than Reed. Wolff's slides are straight forward and to the point, but DEFENITELY attend lectures because the slides don't have all the information. Do not miss lectures, you will fall behind and once you do there is no recovery. Don't let Wolff's pessimism about the course difficulty scare you. How do you study for this course? Only study what is necessary to answer the practice questions. There are ~200 Q for the whole course, first 100 cover the midterm material. Do not waste your time/effort studying everything, Wolff tests more of the big picture concepts. I can not state how much those practice Q have helped, use them to guide your studying. I repeat, do NOT try to study everything it is impossible. study only what is needed based on the practice work. trust me, this was my second attempt at the course. Heed my advice. Other than that, I highly recommend making review notes/summaries/diagrams after every lecture. Not at the end of the week, I mean same-day of the lecture. People always tell you to \"review while the material is fresh\" but take that seriously in 308 because there is just so much content. Use diagrams whenever you can, it helps you see similarities/differences between prok vs euk processes",
      "Incredibly hard but rewarding course, probably my favorite I've taken so far as a biology student. Lots of content, so studying frequently is pretty much required, but some of the concepts can be pretty much skipped without really losing all that many marks. Just need to find a balance. Dr. Wolff was a great prof, very polarizing in his cynical and sarcastic teaching style but I found him very engaging.",
      "Anirban Banerjee has to be the worst professor that I've ever had. He is actually terrible. He rambles on and on about so much random stuff and at the end he'll say \"but you don't need to know this\". Towards the end of the term he spent so much time saying random stuff that he didn't have time to teach us the content left before the final. He would go through 10 slides and then give us 20 slides for self-study. He doesn't allow voice recording nor does he post lecture recording so u need to pay attention to his rambling. His class literally gave me depression. "

Most of the content is plasmid stuff and molecular bio obviously but they all leak into each other and lack clear distinctions. there were weekly assignments where you had to answer a bunch of questions from the lecture and then answer the questions during the tutorial. there were i believe 2 midterms and a final. YOU WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH TIME TO COMPLETE THEM! My advice take it in the fall so you can suffer with your fellow students and the content is less atrocious but the fall prof is equally horrible. she would get angry at students and call them disappointments for asking simple questions. this course is an exemplification of why profs are not teachers just tenured research scientists that think they actually know what theyre doing. \nthe course material is actually useful if its taught correctly but its very research based and cluttered.

The mechanisms and data interpretation of each method is discussed. So in essence, this course is sorta like prepping you for one huge lab exam. The content itself isn't terrible. The assessments are very application oriented so results interpretation is a MUST (and it better be a thorough understanding), its not just about explaining mechanisms. the assessments were what made the course difficult, you need to really get in the mindset of knowing when to explain \"X is significant because Y\". Aside from that, 309 is a really interesting course and the material will be very useful for other labs",

      "I ended up with a very high mark in this course (90+). That being said, I know a lot of people who didn't do as well as they liked (low to mid 80s). There's lots of little assignments but they're easy to do well on. There's weekly labs which have weekly lab quizzes (that are really easy as long as you listen to the prelab talk of the previous lab). There's 3 assignments that are assigned during the lab that you need to finish before the end of the lab (also very easy) as long as you listen during the prelab talk.  There's a group presentation, I think it was 5 minutes and marked very easily. It also helped with the final exam. And there's also a herbarium assignment where you have to collect plants, draw them and name them. This course is more of an evolutionary history of plants, which I wasn't expecting. I found the exams to be fair, just make sure you know everything. A lot of things that didn't seem like main ideas were on the exam. There's not too much content and it's pretty easy to get caught up in. ",
      "Coming from a biologist who really likes flowers, this course was both interesting and easy for me. It is so much information put into one course but it builds on key evolutionary trends of the different families of flowering plants which makes it easier to follow along. The slides get confusing and tend to jump around a lot; I found it easiest to switch some slides around or delete duplicates after lecture to help me study later on.\nThe lab was pretty simple and easy to follow along in. You just look at some flowers under a microscope and dissect them.  Take pictures of the flowers you look at though because there are weekly (non-cumulative) lab quizzes!\n\nI found that those who took this course who are in other majors (other than biology) or different faculties all together struggled with the course. BIOL 120 and BIOL 165 are the best foundation for BIOL 325 which all biology majors take. \n\nIt was a worth while course to take. I really have a greater appreciation for how diverse and advanced flowers can be!\n",
      "Work load is a bit heavy with the mandatory labs. Half florals are not very easy to do, especially online where you cannot interact with the specimen yourself. Lab quizzes are pretty easy. Midterm is decent as long as you know your stuff and study for it. ",

      "A lot of material in this course. Definitely challenging but it's doable if you're able to keep the big picture in mind and see how all the pieces fit together.",
      "This course is exhaustingly difficult and the lab is joyless exercise of patience. Moira Glerum tries really hard to teach the material clearly and is great with help outside the class. The lecture material is 90% mechanism/theory but the exams/midterms largely test your ability to derive experiments to show xyz thing is happening in the cell (hint: the answer is invariably GFP related). In spite of the capacious cranial space, time and effort  required to appreciate the material, the course is a curation of all the essential cellular biology you'll need to work in an advanced research lab. Very difficult, Very useful",
      "I learned so much from this course it's hard to re-cap. It's a must-take course not only because it's compulsory for biochem students, but because it provides a lot of information relevant to experiments at the cellular and molecular level. Take this if you need to, or if you have a burning passion for experimental design because her tests are half long-answer. The course content is indeed heavy and *possibly* one of the hardest courses you'll take! ",
      "A lot of content. Keep up and actually read the textbook. ",
      "Very content heavy, textbook reading is a must. However, most of the questions are application. You will need to design experiments to show where a protein is or what is does. When in doubt, GFP will always give you a mark. The application part is interesting but she expects you to know how to design an experiment properly even if she doesn't go over it. Made 309/308 a pre-req for this reason but 309/308 explains how experiments work but not how to design experiments for specific hypothetical functions of an unknown proteinX. Experiments used for midterm are repetitive and fairly straight forward but for the final, she expects new material that she doesn't explain. Take a shot everytime she says \"beautiful example\". ",
      "Lots of (what I assume will be) useful content, but its difficulty lies in the sheer amount of memorization that's required for the course. Make sure to study and stay on top of your readings for this one, it's very hard to study last minute and do well.",
      "This is one of my favourite courses ever. It's not easy due to the amount of information you need to know - she openly states that there is not enough time in the lectures to say everything, and that we must make our own notes from the chapters as well. \nThat said: the course is very well organized, it's fascinating material, and if you keep up with the notes (which is absolutely KEY), then the exams really aren't bad at all. She uses about half multiple choice and half long answer, where you propose experiments using various tools learned in class. She's great about emphasizing what's important, so it's easy to take good notes. \nThe lab was just changed this semester (no more 40 page report!), and while it definitely needs work (being the pilot class was not so much fun), it's a great introduction to some key molecular biology techniques.",
      "This course is very difficult. This course expects you to really know your stuff. Impossible to get multiple choice correct unless you understand all of the content, and the application questions also require you to really know the content. And there is a lot of it! So much content! The course, overall, really tests your ability to design simple experiments to test hypotheses. I would say the worst part of the whole course is the lab. It's very disorganized and boring (groups of 8 working on a single western blot). ",
      "This course is honestly the hardest course I have taken so far during undergrad (it made my term the worst 4 months of my life) but it is so useful. You have to be prepared to put in hours upon hours in order to succeed. I recommend writing down key points and basic diagrams on a whiteboard and studying the slides that in order to retain the information. The course is not just regurgitation of information, its applying the information to experiments and using the course information to prove what the problem is. I also highly recommend buying the textbook, it's a great resource. ",
      "The course was fairly straightforward. You just had to memorize and understand the content on the slides and repeat the information on the term test and exam, no trick questions. Most of the content was a repeat of BIOL 130 which made it a bit boring. Similarly, the lab was also a bit boring. On paper, the experiments were relevant, but when done in-person, they did not work out in the end, and they had very long wait times. I think the only interesting thing about the lab was the western blot."

    "reviews": [
      "It's difficult to extract the value from this course, but knowledge of immunology has many, many applications. I wasn't able to see things come together until studying for the final, mostly because of the course's poor organisation (but also somewhat because of the lacklustre lecturing)",
      "Course: Interesting content, but order of material was not ideal for learning. Could not follow from the textbook because lectures were not in the same order: would take half of chapter 11 and pair it with chapter 4, then 3 weeks later do first part of chapter 11. Quizzes were due before beginning a new chapter and prof would post them less than 48 hrs before they were due (one time, a quiz was posted less than 24 hrs before it was due - during peak midterm season!) Required to read  whole chapters but only material covered in class were testable, making student waste time reading things they don't need to know. Prof was way too fast and powerpoint slides were lacking important details, making it difficult to follow in class.\nLab: completely unrelated and out of sequence with  the course component e.g. did vaccines in the first lab but talked about vaccines in the last lecture. ",
      "Course was split in half, with Dr. Barbara Katzenback teaching the first midterm material, Dr. Brian Dixon teaching the second midterm material, and taking turns with the rest. Course was largely disorganized and all over the place.\nClickers for marks were used sporadically for a while and then suddenly dropped. Required to read whole chapters to do prechapter quizzes for marks before every class. Readings were not helpful, and only a fraction of the reading was actually covered in class, making it a huge time sink with little return. Prechapter quizzes were suddenly dropped halfway through the course. For a course that was repeatedly stressed to be \"process driven\" and \"integrative\" and \"tying things together\", there was more hyperfocus on details like memorizing cytokine/chemokine/signalling names (eg. IL-1, IL-3, IL-6, CXCL7, CTLA-4, CD45, CD40L etc) with little effort in class to tie everything together.  Midterm averages were in the 60 range, unsurprisingly. Lab section did not follow lecture material. Class was asked to give a presentation on an assigned topic for no marks at the end of the term.\n\nOverall, course material itself was very interesting, and I'm glad I took it just to brush up on my immuno. However, course execution and layout were poor. ",
      "Course is very useful but there is way too much content to know. You need to know every detail for this course. Course consists of two mid terms, clicker questions, online quizzes (only need to get 75% to get full marks) and a final exam. ",
      "ABSOLUTE WORST COURSE YOU CAN TAKE SIMPLY BECAUSE OF HOW POORLY IT WAS ORGANIZED. She did not teach anything useful or important and expected us to know details of ideas and concepts we never covered in class. Could not follow along with the textbook because for some reason they decided to not follow the order in which a PUBLISHED textbook decided to introduce material. You can work your butt off for this and it will still be horrendous. Good luck though... you'll need it or not CAUSE DONT TAKE THIS COURSE. Only useful cause it is a prereq...",
      "Personally I loved this course, it is hard, but not as hard as rumours make it seem.  A ton of memorization involved but once you start understanding and connecting the concepts you get the hang of it.  The lab was really interesting too.",
      "This course was very poorly organized.  Dr. Dixon took over lectures after the first midterm.  It felt like a different course and did not connect well to the earlier material.  Katzenback and Dixon need to communicate more since Dr. Dixon did not know what was covered before the first midterm and kept asking \"Did you guys cover this already?\"  Only 2 days were left between teaching the material and the midterm.  Dr. Dixon was still teaching new material on Wednesday which was being tested on Friday.  The lab was also horrible.  You can't do well on the quizzes even if you study since the questions are too vague and the expected answers are too specific.  If you like memorizing 50 cytokines, what they do, and their receptors, this course is for you.  Otherwise, would not recommend unless you need it as a prerequisite.  In that case, good luck.",
      "I loved this course! The first ~20 lectures are all about the mechanisms of the immune system. For example, which cells are involved, which molecules signals what, how is the adaptive immune system activated, etc. Then the last ~10 lectures (which was the part I loved) goes through a bunch of different phenomena that the immune system explains. For example, allergies, autoimmunity, AIDS. This course is very heavy, and I can imagine if you do not have a passion for immunology it would be really difficult to study for the long hours it takes to do well. ALSO... YOU NEED TO GO TO LECTURE. In some later lectures Dr. Dixon does NOT write much on the slides, and really only 2-3 molecules on a giant flowchart with 20-30 molecules may be important. In lecture, he'll point this out but you would be lost if you just looked at the slides. The lab is pretty easy overall. You have to write a short lab report for each lab (5 total) but they take ~3 hr if you know your stuff. Overall I would say don't shy away from this course if you're interested in immunology, but also, don't take this if you're not really interested and just need a 300 level course. ",
      "It is true what they say, this course is very hard. But it wasn't the lecture that brought my grade down, it was the stupid lab that we're forced to take with it. I mean, has a Cheryl Duxbery lab ever been good? I do not recommend. Lab quizzes every week, Lab report every two weeks, Lab exam. Why? Literally why. And they're all hard. Ridiculous",
      "The content for the course is easy to understand and there are numerous resources out there about each topic so there weren\u2019t any issues learning the information. However, the hard part is that there are a ton of things to learn and memorize, and we pretty much covered almost every section of the textbook in 4 months. You definitely do not want to fall behind! Even once you memorize everything, the multiple choice will still be challenging. The lab was very similar to other labs run by Dr. Duxbury so if you are fluent with how biology lab reports are marked (be sure to look at BIOL 240L as reference) and how questions are asked in her quizzes and exams, it shouldn\u2019t be too much trouble.",
      "really awesome class, but it is a lot of work and pure memorization. Dr. Dixon is a very good teacher and simplifies inherently complex topics really well. It is a very content heavy course and you cannot learn all of it, but if you put in the effort you can do well. The lab is not easy if you don't come very prepared. Make sure to study well for the lab quizzes because they are short answer, not that many questions but each is worth about 2.5% of your grade, which adds up quick. Study the theory of the lab you are about to do!!",
      "Took this course in W23. We had a 25% midterm, 40% final, a few open-book quizzes worth a total of 5%, and a 30% lab component. I felt completely lost during most lectures, but my real mistake was ignoring how behind I was until the midterm and final. Once I sat down with the textbook, re-watched the lectures, and mapped things out, the concepts clicked. The lab wasn't too bad since they only required \"lab summaries\" (always less than 8-10 pages) instead of full lab reports. Finished with an 87.",
      "Interesting class. LOTS of concepts, do not fall behind. I did not put in the extra time for this course and failed the midterm, and therefore had to drop the class. If this is an elective for you, make sure you are prepared to PUT IN THE WORK. Lab component was very interesting. "

The labs are complex, but not very hard and the lab reports are marked quite easily as I got all between low to high 90s on all.

      "Pretty chill course. Each unit can be easily summarized into ~2 pages with some diagrams. the content itself is pretty neat, and straightforward. nothing is particularly confusing. This isn't a molecular-bio type of course so don't worry about memorizing detailed structures or mechanisms. Just know key characteristics (eg fused carbon ring structure, toxicant generates of ROS, etc). As for the lab, the procedures are pretty simple although sometimes laborious. If you've taken dedicated lab courses before (eg 348L), this will feel like a snoozefest (I almost always finished early). The lab reports are a mess though, the instructions for how to analyze the data is absolute garbage and what should be an easy results section is always turned into a confusing mess. Otherwise the actual report length is pretty short and the discussions shouldn't be difficult to write up. Duxbury was in charge of the labs, but in typical Duxbury fashion you're not going to see her ever and it's really just the TA's there"

      "Good course for anyone interested in health and biology. I really enjoyed the aging perspective. Definitely need to understand the material, not just memorize it, but as long as you understand how all the concepts tie together, you'll be fine.",
      "Duxbury is a great proff, despite what some people are saying here. Her slides are cluttered, but by the time you get to 3rd year you should be able to figure out the important concepts. There is a lot of information presented in this course, but if you have a brain you can sift through. She ends up telling you exactly what is on the final anyways, and says exactly what to focus on. There were no surprises. \nThe course has a lot of material, you need to really know your stuff because her midterms and exams are all long answer. If you are good at memorizing and cram last minute, expect a 70%, if you really know your stuff easy 85+. \nThe intro of the course is very similar to GERON255 but goes into more depth on many topics.",
      "Great course! Really interesting! If you pay attention to what she says in class you will do fine, watch out for writing in detail on midterms and exams.",
      "I really enjoyed the contents of this course. I felt like it was a good balance of gerontology content and science, and highlighted the reasoning behind a lot of illnesses, ailments, and needs of geriatrics. There was a ton of content but if you take the time to summarize, it's definitely doable!  I actually enjoyed studying for it because the content was interesting and the application questions were logical. ",
      " A really interesting course but Duxbury is a mess teaching it. She is very unorganized, slides are piled full of information in a way that makes it hard to determine what is useful and necessary to learn. She also tends to make mistakes in what she is saying when she reads off the slides so write down everything she says but make sure it matches her slides. The midterm and final are HELL. Study your ass off because they are mainly long answer questions that require paragraphs of information to get a decent mark; luckily, all her questions come directly from the slides so just know everything and you'll be good! Finished with a 90, but studied for the final for at least 2 weeks, rewrote my notes at least 10 times. Really interesting content, though. ",
      "I was told this class was going to be difficult prior to starting it and boy were people wrong. The content in this course is very intuitive and there is very little actual science and science background involved. The course itself is pretty interesting and Duxbury included everything in her slides already so there was no need to come to class all the time. She did do bonus clicker questions which was great. The hardest thing about this course were the exams, they were both purely written exams but the content was easy to know so your hand hurt at the end but if you study you shouldn't have a problem finishing the tests with time to spare.",
      "This course is not easy but also not hard. Going to the lectures helps a lot, but it's not required. However, if you do go to the lectures and you don't understand something, you can ask her questions after and she'll explain more in depth until you get the concept. The midterm/final is pretty straight forward, you just need to know your content, and be able to write continuously through the entire time given because it's short/long answers.",
      "Honestly I really did enjoy this class - the content is easy and fun. The biggest critique is that her midterm and final are ALL WRITTEN answers and she is a tough marker. She wants a massive wall of text for every question. I did well on the midterm (90s) but I memorized almost everything on her slides and as soon as the clock started I word-vomitted it all out onto the page. She wants things in sentences too, so don't just put down points. During her tests, just go go go (you don't have time to plan/think through, just write). I actually did have time to spare for the midterm, but I used it to double check things. Go to class to! she offers a bonus 1-2% with clicker q's. Biggest advice for this class: memorize things so well that you can just write on & on about them (& fast too).",
      "This course starts off on a great note and becomes a bit more dry only to really become interesting again once you get to the biology. Although there can be lots of details in the slides, do not get bogged down with each piece, rather focus on the bigger picture. For the examinations, they are very fair question wise, but you will need to write in great detail to get full marks.",
      "This course was pretty interesting, you get to learn about the aging process from a mostly biology standpoint. It had a very heavy focus on your understanding of concepts, not just memorization of terms/facts. The midterm (30%) and final (55%) were almost completely short answer/long answer questions, and Duxbury expects highly detailed answers including statistics from studies/experimental evidence she discussed in the lectures to back up your answers. I found her lectures to be very repetitive (she likes to say the same thing over and over again) and boring at times (she also likes to spend 10 minutes talking about a single diagram/picture). Dr.Duxbury enjoys teaching this course, so I found her to be a lot more empathetic with her students than I've seen in my 2nd year labs with her. She made the final exam online for us so that it would be less stressful and we would have more time to write it, which I was grateful for. ",
      "Took this course in Winter 2022 where half of it was online and the other half in person. The marking scheme was 15% quizzes (best 10 out of 11), 30% midterm and 55% final exam. The final exam was NOT cumulative and based on post midterm material. The midterm and final exam were both primarily written with short and long answer questions. Dr. Duxbury constantly asks for detailed answers and examples. This course covers so much content and many body systems like the cardiovascular, skeletal, vision and skin. It is hard to get over a 90+ in this class, but 80+ is possible. Finished with a hihg 80. Took this course simultaneoulsy with BIOL 373 and there is little overlap. BIOL 373 is easier as I finished that with a low 90.",
      "Good class, interesting content. Would definitely recommend if you want to learn about different pathologies that happen to the elderly. Her testing style can be difficult though, no MC all word problems and she'll want you to write as detailed as possible. ",
      "The course breakdown was 60% Final, 30% Midterm, 10% Iclickers. The midterm and final are fully written, so be prepared to write a lot. Duxbury really focuses on the big picture and relating everything back to aging inteself from a biological standpoint. It is fairly easy to do well in this course, 80+ only if you go to class and pay attention, if you put in the extra work 90+ is very possible. \nPlease go to her office hours, she is so chill and will take the time to fully answer your questions. Make your own notes ontop of the lecture slides and use whiteboards to study. Flashcards are useless for this class.",
      "Super easy class, the only thing is that her test format can be jarring. It's all written answer and you need to be as specific and detailed as possible. If you don't do awesome on the midterm, don't worry, you know how to study for the final now, which is the exact same. Very predictable exam questions, you can easily pre-write your answers for at least half the tested material once you have done that first exam just by guessing what she will ask."

      "Very interesting and thorough course.  Lectures are interesting and well worth attending. Many of the concepts you learn here pop up in other 300 and 400 level biology courses in varying forms.",
      "The prof makes the class really enjoyable. But he has tricky midterms. However I would recommend this class. ",
      "memorizing words of the day for this course very very advantageous during examinations; he gives quite a bit of bonus points!",
      "I absolutely loved this course - in fact, it has been my favourite course so far in university. I found the topics to be incredibly interesting and the marking was fair. Definitely a fantastic course!",
      "A must have course for biology",
      "Amazing course, amazing proff, enough said. \nBut It kind of is a dead end course in my opinion, doesn't really get you anywhere, but take for a 300BIOL with no lab!",
      "Honestly one of the most interesting biology courses here at UW. Dr. Muller is super friendly and kind! Just make sure you do the readings and go to class and you'll do just fine! Make sure you know your stuff this is by no means a bird course. ",
      "Evolution is a course where you have to apply what you learn and not just rely on memorization. Two midterms, second one cumulative but the first one focussing a lot on population genetics so make sure you know the concepts very well.",
      "Probably one of the most best bio courses for understanding nature and life. Take it if you want to learn about the processes and mechanisms of evolution.",
      "The class reads like a 1st year course but the midterms were surprisingly hard!  Doesn't need as much of a time investment as other 3rd year courses so that's good; doing the readings a few days before the midterms should be okay.  Easy to underestimate but also easy to do well in.",
      "Great course, had some review from Genetics but learned a lot of new stuff.",
      "Super basic concepts of evolution were covered, but the prof was great and made coming to class interesting. This is definitely a bird course (but you should still study a bit). There's two midterms and a final, plus bonus marks on each of those if you can define Hrycyshyn's words of the day. ",
      "Hrycyshyn is an amazing prof, he is really kind in office hours and he delivers the content really well. Easy course but stay on top of it because his multiple choice can be tough. Keep an ear out for what he emphasizes in lecture, that is usually what he puts for his written answer questions. Memorize the words of the day it's a nice bonus. ",
      "So I took this course in the Spring Term over COVID, but it was meant to be offered online so I don't think the syllabus was changed due to COVID. It consisted of 1 Syllabus Quiz worth 1%, 4 MC + Fill in the Blank Quizzes worth 48%, Population Genetics Assignment worth 6% and a 45% final. Note: This is for the online version. From what I know the in-person version has 2 midterms and a final. Overall the content is straightforward but the problem is there is a LOT of content. You don't necessarily need to know the nitty gritty details but there's is still a lot of information you'll need to memorize for exams and such. I don't know it's normally done too but the final when I took it was like ~30 questions long with MC, Fill-in-the-Blank and Select all that Apply.",
      "fantastic course so interesting. its one of those courses where you can kind of understand the world around you. it debunks lots of pseudoscientific myths that can be refreshing with all the misinformation on the internet these days. the best part is learning about great apes! take this course for fun, or if you need a softer biol course ",
      "I took this class Winter 2021 and had a really bad experience. The content itself is not complicated, I even found some things quite interesting to learn about. However, the 4 quizzes (1 hour for 24 questions) throughout the term, were not easy at all. There were questions that didn't relate to the content and seemed purposely like it was just trying to trick you into selecting a wrong answer. This unfortunately followed through to the exam, 83 questions in two hours, which after contacting other students, many had a bad experience with the exam thinking they did well but getting a bad final mark. No understanding or help from this prof either it is overall just a tragic course. I made pages and pages of notes and reviewed all modules and textbook pages highlighted, so failing the exam was not due to lack of studying.",
      "First of all the professor is amazing, Dr.Witt does a great job with making the videos engaging and I could listen to him explain things all day. I also found the material interesting it really changes your view of the world around you especially a lot of the concepts and case studies explained. The problem I and most people had was the level difficulty in the quizzes and exam. There was not really enough time to read through all the questions and think about an answer because some of them were so long. A lot of the MC questions were tricky, i.e A,B,C and then option D would be something like A and C and option E would be all of the above. The content was not necessarily hard to understand, the questions were just long and in my opinion too difficult.",
      "Only take this course, if you absolutely need it.\nThe course was bland, 70% of the course was textbook readings, other 30% was lecture videos. \nUsually there is around 3-4 HRS of videos and like 100pages of readings a week. \nTook this course in SPRING 2021, throughout the course, it felt like the professor, was setting us up for failure. Quizzes were practically unfinished, constantly altering the answers after submission which made it impossible to study for the final. \nFinal exam was fair, but required the textbook readings to do well. \nBest advice is to do well in the assignments, quizzes because the final will bring down your final mark. \n",
      "If you are into biodiversity then this is a very interesting course. But either way, I would recommend not taking the online version because it is a bit dry and the quizzes and exam ARE BRUTAL",
      "Snooze Fest. But Dr. Witt has a really cool voice",
      "i love evolution so i took this course but this course is more difficult than I anticipated. the quizzes and final are pretty tricky. i thought this course would be memorization based but it's a lot more application and understanding based. you need to thoroughly understand the content to do well on the quizzes and the final. the assignment was very easy tho so it'll help boost your mark. don't take this course unless you're ready to put in effort like any other 300 level bio course",
      "This course was a review of most information that you have likely already learned in previous biology classes. Most of the class was based on the textbook which could be quite dry. The quizzes were quite unpredictable with which information would or would not be covered so it is important to understand all of the readings. Overall was not too difficult, but also did not feel like much new information after all of the introductory biology courses.",
      "Awesome course. 2 x 25% midterms and a 50% final with Dr. Witt. Study the cases studies/examples because they are all fair game on the exams. Just make sure you go to the lectures and actually study for the exams and it will be easy to do well.",
      "Took this course  in Winter 2022 where half of the course was taken online and the other half in person. This course is really easy if you attend all lectures. Dr. Witt made this course really engaging and interesting. There are many case studies you will need to know. The makring scheme was 50% midterms (2 x 25) and 50% final exam. The midterms and final all follow the same formula with MC, True or False, Fill in the Blank and Long Answer. To do well in the course please remorize the words of the day as Dr. Witt goes bonus marks for the final and midterms that can bump your bump up. You do not need the textbook to do well in this course. Finished this course with a high 90.",
      "Fantastic course. Grade is entirely based on 2 optional midterms and a final. But if you regularly attend lectures you should be more than prepared for them. Witt is an excellent lecturer, and the content was very interesting. ",
      "The course is overall really straight forward and I personally found the content super interesting. It was divided up into 2x 25% midterms and a 50% final. The tests were MC, fill in the blank, short answer, and long answer. Witt gives the option that midterms are \"optional\", meaning that you can skip them and just transfer the weight to the final but I highly advise against doing that. He uses a lot of questions from the midterms on the final and some of the more challenging questions from midterm 1 appeared on midterm 2 as well. \n\nIn terms of course material, he says that you need to read the textbook but honestly you don't need to. His slides are a lot of copy paste from the book and you can just fill in the holes during lecture. That being said, I've heard that he doesn't give as detailed slides in the spring term since the course is online so in that case you might need to read the textbook. \n\nOverall, not hard to do well if you are good at memorizing a lot of details.",
      "The course content was super easy to understand and interesting on its won, however I personally found the lecture to be painfully boring which is really unfortunate. Grades only came from 2 midterms and a final (mc+short answer), so not a lot of opportunities to make up marks. I didn't bother buying the textbook, skipped half the classes, and still finished comfortably with a 90. ",
      "Online biol 359 with in person midterm + exam. The content is pretty easy and straightforward. Low effort studying. the problem is that Messier's test questions are confusing as fuck. No matter how much you study, you can't really get a high mark because you're inevitably losing a few marks because you misunderstood what the fuck the questions were asking for. Also, Messier's quizzes are entirely MCQ but its all \"select all that are true\" , so you start second guessing yourself after like 5 questions. Again, the material is perfectly fine (hence the easy rating). Messier's quizzes are shit"

Even disregarding that the subject matter is dry, and that Roland Hall is a decent guy, just don't even bother.\n\nIf you actually want to learn how to use SPSS, you're better served with online tutorials and such than by wasting a course and the associated time and tuition money.",
      "The professor is a lovely, wonderful man, who is also very aware of how boring the course is. The assignments are really rather brutal - you'll but a LOT of time into them, and still only get a mid-80. The rubrics are really really specific. The lectures were pretty dry, and not all of the content was tested - the prof does a very good job telling you what will be on the midterms and finals. DO THE PRACTISE FINAL - it is REALLY similar to the actual one. The content is very useful for future courses. \n\nAs another commenter said, and this is really important, memorize the degrees of freedom equations, and the assumptions for each statistical test (really easy marks!) for the midterm and final, and be able to read and interpret the SPSS outputs he'll show in class/you'll generate yourself.

      "A bit dry, but Dr. Hall's lecture slides contained literally everything you need to know for the midterm and final, so you barely need to take notes. The tutorials were pointless and mostly unhelpful but mandatory, unfortunately.\n\nThe content itself is actually super useful! All my graphs in all my other courses are going to be beautiful from now on. We used SPSS a lot for data analysis.",
      "great course truly fantastic and super useful. if you took stat 202 and thought it was enough for the real world it isnt. This is true statistics of scientific data i highly recommend. The lab/tut weren't very helpful online i kinda just watched them do a demo but it didnt help for the assignments. for the assignments i would just read over the lectures, and the lab answer pdf. make sure you join a class groupchat youre allowed to help each other since the TAs never respond probably too busy with their phds so keep that in mind. overall the course wasnt hard you can easily get a 90 if you start assignments early and prepare for exams. 4 assignments are most of the grade, 2 take home exams lovely course great prof. the late days are 10% each so work ahead",
      "I didn't enjoy this course simply because the marking was terrible. I had no idea what to do at times and so it was confusing and stressful. It's not terribly hard but it's not that easy either. It's probably useful if you want to go into research though. ",

It's surprisingly useful and relevant to my other courses and coops, and it's great to have a formal introduction to a whole plethora of databases/analysis websites.

Dr. McConkey is a very smart guy who clearly has lots of experience in bioinformatics, but his experience doesn't translate very well to teaching.

      "Was a difficult course that required a lot of studying. Overall useful, with a strong focus on the kidneys and hormones. Dr. Engelhardt's tests are extremely specific and tricky! The lab that accompanies this was boring but easy. This course is definitely doable, but be prepared to really put the work in and study the details!!!!",
      "Easier than 273. I recommend using the textbook and other sources to help clarify what Heidi teaches you as her slides tend to be mostly pictures from the Silverthorn textbook.",
      "This course is easier than 273 in my opinion. If you have Heidi she ends up emphasizing a lot of the important information in class, especially when doing clicker questions.",
      "Dr. Engelhardt is a gem! She handled this COVID-19 term amazingly. In general, for 373 I would really recommend re-listening to lectures (you can ask for permission to record), it truly does make all the difference. She only tests what she actually taught (don't need to go into the textbook for anything). Personally, I found the midterms and exam very very fair (and on the easy end). Do the LEARN activity (renal handling, the neural one) before tests, its worth it trust me! Review clicker Q's as practice before tests to, again its worth it!! if your struggling there's loads of youtube videos to help supplement, but make sure you stay on top because things do build.",
      "Great course, dont like heidi's qurestions",
      "Great course and great prof! Topics are difficult but not more than you would expect from a course of this level. The prof takes her time to make sure everyone is understanding. Lots of opportunities to bring your marks up through little assignments and there is a lot of practice material given. Test are made fair and if you study well then you will do well!",
      "super interesting course. I think this course is more understanding-oriented rather than memorization tho since Heidi's questions are the classic A, B, C, all of the above, none of the above and a lot of her questions are application-based. make sure you give yourself plenty of time to study and you'll do great. finished this course with an 88",
      "This is meant to be a second year class however the topics covered vs what appeared on the evaluations were very different. Dr. Engelhardt is very unclear with her teaching style so going to class was a literal waste of time. ",
      "Really great course. Some units are much harder than others. You absolutely cannot just memorize, you have to be able to apply what you learn. Heidi is a great prof especially if you're into clinical applications. Her tests are hard core application questions, way less memorization than you might expect. You can do well in this course but there are no gimmes outside of the Kritik assignments.",
      "I have to say, Heidi Engelhardt is a gem. She is very passionate in the topics that she teaches, and she gives many extra activities/in class time to help further your understanding of topics discussed in the lecture videos. Compared to biol 273, this course is a lot more focused on your understanding of systems and how they are all interrelated instead of pure memorization. I did find the course to be pretty time consuming with weekly/biweekly open-book quizzes (5%), kritik assignments (30%), lectures (5%), and midterms (15% and 20%). But this made the final (25%) a lot less stressful so I found it was worth it. If you have any kind of interest in how our CNS, GI tract, and kidneys function, you will love this course!",
      "Took this course with Dr. Engelhert in Winter 2022 where half of the course was online and the other half in person. The marking scheme was 30% kritik (5% x 6), 2 midterms 35% (15% and 20%), 5% participation quizzes and 25% final exam. This course is not hard. The textbook is not required as the exam questions are from the recorded screencasts and slides. The hardest part may be the Kritiks since often times peers will actually give you a lower mark so you may need to dispute your mark to have it marked higher. Finished with a low 90 but 80+ is definitely possible.",
      "The content was interesting, but the delivery was awful. Typical engelhardt-just recorded lectures on Learn and they aren't even new.",
      "Super interesting and useful course! Heidi really knows her stuff and you can tell by the way she explains concepts in clear detail. Her tests are fair and the kritik assignments and quizzes are easy marks. But I'll admit that I don't like her hybrid model where you need to watch lengthy screencasts before the class and during the class its just review of the content.",
      "Course itself was fine but Heidi is a lazy bum who doesn't know how to teach properly. Just uploaded online lecs with in person mc tests and uses kritik so she basically has to do 0 work. "

I suggest answering all the quiz questions in a doc at the beginning of term that way you can study them last minute before the lab and get an easy 100 every time. the reports are pretty typical, nothing hard. The exam was cancelled the year I took it. Definitely a 90+",

The lab assignments were marked very generously and weren't too time consuming to do, which was a pleasant surprise after doing biol 240 and 241 lab reports. The lab test (20%) was a lot more difficult than expected, since they basically said that if you studied the experiment background material/results you would be well prepared, however there were a lot of 273 and 373 content questions that were poorly related to the labs. ",
      "I did this course online with Dr. Wolff. Lab assignments are super easy as long as you know how to write a lab report but without all the formalities. 20% final test was actually difficult and had a lot of material from BIOL 273 and 373 lecture courses that were not covered in the labs, so study for it. Ended up with a 93. It's a fun, easy course, especially if your'e into clinical applications.",

I spent hours trying to find the papers he was referencing to make my own notes about his slides because I skipped some classes. \nLong answer exams seem intimidating also, but if you know your stuff, try to predict what he will ask and you will be fine! He is very fair, if too many students bomb a question, he will take it off. ",
      "I took this course with Trevor Charles in the Winter 2023 term. This course has so much potential to be extremely useful and engaging. I am sure that Dr. Charles is highly respected as a researcher but his inability to teach made this course a chore. Some of the topics covered in the course include transposon mutagenesis, plasmid conjugation, metagenomics, the history of bacterial genetics, genome engineering, and a variety of relevant research articles. There were two midterms and a final exam. The grading scheme was extremely flexible since the two midterms could weigh anywhere between 0-60% and the final exam could weigh anywhere between 40-90%.

This is actually a very interesting course with quite some useful and fascinating content, some of which overlap with BIOL 469/266. If you are interested in genetics, it should be a fun ride. Based on the few lectures I attended, discussions occurring in class could also be intriguing sometimes as many people there genuinely enjoy the subject. \nMidterm and term paper are all very fair. I marked \"easy\", not easy as in a sense that you could ace it without trying (I failed miserably), but easy as if you did put some effort, nothing there to trick you. Dr. Duncker has been a great prof, clear, organized, responsible and passionate. The structure of the course is very helpful, the videos and the literature reviews are all useful, one of the few courses I feel very rewarding and enjoyable during final review time, thus the urge of this lengthy review. \nThe slides are only simple skeletons, so you need to attend lectures to get the full content, especially the graphs. However the textbook is great help too as the lectures follow pretty closely to the text. \nI would definitely recommend this course to anyone interested in genetics and/or biotech.",

He also invites guest lecturers and covers some recent research. His slides can be very vague, they only have a few words and you DEFINITELY have to go to lectures to get the full context but they aren't too dry. We had a term paper assignment which I actually enjoyed since you got to read more about some niche new research topic. If you're into genetics I highly recommend this. ",

The midterms were open book, 2.5 hours long and were all long answer application questions. Professor Buckley does give you tips on how to optimize your notes for quick reference during the tests, but they are still challenging even with your notes next to you so you do still need to study."

Add this to the fact that you have to fill in 100 marks of non multiple choice questions in a 50 minute midterm and you do not have \"an easy 90\". The reason why a lot of people likely thought that this course was easy, is because there is a circulating google doc that has all the previous midterms/tests in it. Therefore, if you have an extensive social group, you were bound to get the doc early, and study only according to the doc, and therefore were likely to get a solid 100% for solely memorizing what you knew would be tested. However, if you are like me, and had to do it the old fashioned way and try to study everything and only focusing heavily on the stuff that he stressed  in class, it is a much different story. Now i wasn't expecting extremely easy, but i was hoping it would balance out my other 4th year courses and it is currently my lowest grade out of all 6. So if you are considering taking this course because you need a higher level course, but still want to get a good grade relatively easily, Would not recommend.",

      "I have to disagree with everybody saying this class is an easy 90. It's about as hard as any of the other 400-level biol courses I've taken. The big issue I have with this course is the grading of the exams. Each question is granted a seemingly arbitrary number of marks regardless of how long or short the question is so if you make the most modest of mistakes, you can lose big marks. I came out of each exam very confident in how well I did, but received only okay grades. I learned a lot in this course, and enjoyed it. It's especially enjoyable if you're interested in important secondary metabolic pathways. Greenberg can be a funny guy sometimes and he's clearly passionate about the material. I don't appreciate how the exams are marked so fast; it's explicitly told to you that everything is marked as fast as possible. If I'm paying the university thousands of dollars to take their classes, the possibility of some TA blasting through my exam rubs me the wrong way. ",

Clearly something was not adding up, the breakdown was 70% 2 Tests, 30% 3 'Papers.' The organization of the course was horrible the TA was basically the only person I saw in tutorials I don't even know if our Professor actually existed like I only heard his voice in the pre-recorded lectures. Post and announcements were made by the TA, it wasn't hard content but it was really badly organized which made it hard to study for.",
      "Took it online, it was hard to absorb material from the slides/videos but there were three papers (on literally anything mentioned in class) that were worth 30% that were easy to do well on bc they were peer-reviewed, and two quizzes/tests that weren't terrible as long as you did the practice quiz and understood the way that they asked questions. Also only had 10 weeks of content to learn which was nice.",

In terms of course breakdown, you have 1 midterm, participation marks from iClickers, a group project, and the final.

      "One of my easier courses this term. Interesting material. Can easily catch up if you miss a few classes.",
      "Course consists of a mid term, term paper with a partner, an assignment on simple calculations, and an exam. \nVery easy course that requires little work during the term. \nMid term and exam have lots of long answers, but you can choose which questions to answer so you can do well in the exam. ",
      "Like most micro courses, if you like the content you'll do well and find it easy, if not, goodluck. The course is not bad though, the dreakdown consisted of a midterm, a partnered term paper an assignment and a final. The midterm was very straightforward (especially since there wasn't tons of content). The paper and assignments were very easy to do well on (80+); she'll tell you you can't get a good grade leaving them to the last minute but I did both the day before they were due and got 100 on them so don't stress. The final was very fair of the content covered; unfortunately, Barb was replaced halfway through the term by a M.Chaudet who was not the greatest prof in the world. She practically read from the slides without useful elaboration and wasted time trying to encourage students to participate in group discussions rather than getting through the material so we could cover the last ad most interesting topic of the course. ",
      "Its just a public health course that's it pretty straightforward information. you'll have to caclulcate some formulas about how infections spread and stuff like that but its not hard. there's a term paper that you should plan ahead for don't wait until last minute. \nThere's a lot of generalization of africans and caribbeans in the context of public health failures and half of the content is insensitive towards developing countries. there's no reason why the examples cannot come from Canada. ironically it seems like little awareness went into this course, but perhaps as expected since barb was replaced by Chaudet who is not a public health professional \ninteresting to know if you ever want a healthcare job if youre more interested in raw biology this course is just for fun.",
      "Since Butler retired I think the difficulty of the course went up so this course was affected. The breakdown was 25% Midterm, 10% 6 Discussion Posts, 15% Group Term Paper, 10% Calculation Assignment, 25% Final, and a 5% swing mark. The content was okay as it followed up with stuff from 240, 241 and 447, but the organization was horrendous in my opinion. I don't know what Dr. Chaudet was thinking, but modules consisted of like 15 learn pages, when she could just put it into like one powerpoint or something. The midterm was said to have MC, BUT it was all written response like ???. The term paper was very straightforward, and calculation assignment was pretty easy and the discussions were also easy marks, so the course was kinda like 50/50",
      "Macdonald is one of the worst profs I have ever had. If you have Jacqueline Macdonald...RUN",
      "tests and assignments were fair, we got to bring a cheat sheet for midterm and exam (v helpful). Mid 80 for midterm, final mark low 80. She gave us weekly quizzes (lowkey hard, but also you did them as a group) and 2 group assignments (peer marked) but they weren't exactly mark boosters.  Content was mostly interesting (admittedly I did fall asleep one class), and we only had one lecture a week so there wasn't too much content. The other week we'd do the group quiz. I studied maybe 1 day for the exam? and it was very very bad studying. so overall it was pretty easy I'd say",
      "This class was really interesting and not heavy at all. Her marking scheme was admittedly very weird, which made it difficult to get high marks on components that should have been mark boosters (weekly open book quizzes, group assignments, peer marking). The midterm and final weren't too challenging especially considering we got cheat sheets. I wouldn't take the super harsh comments for this course very seriously... prof MacDonald is incredibly nice (we had a movie week and she brought all of us chips) and for a 400-level bio course the content is a breeze.

      "Boring course that was taught poorly. Can be useful if you are going into the environmental consulting field. ",
      "I was looking forward to this course but it turned out to be very disappointing, mainly due to the professor who taught it.\n\nFirstly, no course schedule was given despite several students asking for one.  We had 5 assignments (1 essay, 4 assignments using R, and a final ERA along with a group presentation).  Since no assignment schedule was given, it was hard to plan assignments around other courses and assignments were given very sporadically.  \n\nSecondly, he does not give enough time to complete assignments.  He assigned the final ERA (worth 30 %) with no warning during the last few weeks of November, which is the busiest time of the school year.  Almost the whole class had to half-ass the ERA due to lack of time.  After we handed in our ERAs, he assigned us groups and only gave us 5 days to prepare a 10-15 minute presentation worth 15% of our mark, also in the busiest last weeks of the semester.  This caused stress among all group members due the tight timeline.\n\nLastly, there was a final exam but no midterm.  This left the class having no idea what to expect for the final exam.\n\nI ended up getting a pretty low mark in this class due to the tight timelines.  Since I wasn't able to plan assignments for this class, it also lowered my mark in other classes.",

Doxey is a great prof and is quite helpful when it comes to the project and i honestly really enjoy his teaching style. make sure you're confident about the concepts in 266/365 before coming into this course, though. I would recommend it if you enjoyed either one of those two courses. ",

The TAs were very thorough during labs and tutorials and explained concepts very well. Exams were perfectly fair and nothing to complain about.",
      "Would've been very useful if the choice of language wasn't C#... especially since the algorithms course in the following semester is in cpp. Content is pretty much equivalent to completion of high school grade 10 CS. Answers to assignments are pretty much publicized during lectures so they weren't particularly difficult to pass. Extremely easy if you have programming background but can be somewhat overwhelming at first for those without. Course average obscenely high-- I think a quarter of the class had 100%??",

      "Course content was fine, typical coding course and we learned C++. HOWEVER, this was probably because of the professor we had, but our content flow was extremely inefficient in properly delivering concepts to beginner coders. Considering majority of the class had not coded before, we were taught very complex concepts right from the start without any clarification of what they did or why we needed certain concepts. On top of that, we were given a rather difficult final in which we had no practice on(again, this could have been due to the prof we had). I enjoyed the coding aspect of the course, though the course flow definitely needs some adjusting. ",
      "the content increased exponentially in difficulty from the beginning of the course. the pre- and post-midterm assignments were starkly different. this may not be an issue with the course itself and rather the professor, but it did not feel like an introductory course for a cohort of students who mostly had no prior coding experience. \nwe were provided 2 midterm practices without answer keys and for the final, we had no sample finals or any outline of what kinds of questions would be asked. ",
      "This course can be excruciating but is probably the single most useful subject you take in 1A. Will set you up so nicely with a solid foundation of beginner C++ knowledge that Data Structures and Algorithms will be a breeze. That being said content in the second half of the semester is a massive pain and staying motivated can be insanely difficult. Is genuinely interesting to learn about though, especially if you have no prior programming knowledge or experience. TAs can typically make or break the class - mine were a GODSEND I would be shamelessly emailing them at 4 in the morning for help with an assignment just for them to reply 5 minutes later.

They're insanely disorganized and there's a lack of communication on every part of the course. There are no rubrics, marking is up in the air. It depends on their moods. It depends on who marks it. You can get marks off for the prof's \"preferences\". I'm sorry, but this isn't engineering design, it should be called pleasing Borland. And I wish I learned to do that and get good marks, but as I said it's impossible to please him. It's also laughable how Borland is afraid of machine learning. He keeps preaching about how he wants us to learn and employ a good design process, but whenever you even mention machine learning he goes insane and starts ranting about how ML is unreliable and unattainable in this course. He is so opinionated and biased. I'm constantly shocked at the feedback he gives, it's so random, everything is so up in the air. Don't expect a good mark. Don't expect to get rewarded for your efforts. Don't expect to learn anything. Might as well do the bare minimum to do his stupid deliverables and focus on actual courses. Also, in a PROTOTYPING course, we only spent like 2 weeks actually prototyping. The rest of this dumb course was just completing useless deliverables that take a crazy amount of time, don't actually help with design, and you may do poorly on no matter how hard you try. Also, just don't try asking for help. The TAs this term created such a hostile learning environment. They criticize and put down every group's progress, don't clearly answer questions, and are just unhelpful. The information they give is unreliable, many groups got marks off for stuff the TAs said is okay. You can't listen to anyone. And don't ask Borland for help. He just says stuff that means nothing. He just gets philosophical about his outlook on life and design and never answers anything. The only positive part of the course was prof Tripp. He's the only one that gave a straight answer and gave helpful tips. It's sad that Borland was the one in charge. It is just so sad how many incompetent and unorganized professors are allowed to teach BMEs...",
      "I am currently taking this course online, and just like for all my other courses, I came into it with a degree of leniency since it is difficult to teach some courses online. But this whole course was just incredibly confusing. Firstly, in design courses, you just design a product addressing the situation of concern in the best possible way. However, the soc was incredibly specific, to the point where they were pretty much just telling us what to do. They forced us to delegate tasks in a very strict manner. You were discouraged from trying to do a bit of everything or even use each other's testing data. Marking has also been a mess. There are no rubrics, so most marks are just arbitrarily taken off and feedback is haphazard and stale. Instructions for deliverables are incredibly brief and open ended, but marking is very stringent. Furthermore the goal of this course is very unclear because we are not suppose to even achieve a functional prototype, despite being a prototyping course. I am almost done this course and I still don't know what the goal is, it was never actually defined.

      "Awful. Horribly organized. TAs need to get their act together. I genuinely have never taken a worse course. Expectations for the lab reports were clarified sometimes as late as 2-3 days before the submission date, feedback (if you were lucky enough to get any) was completely useless (random question marks with no comments) and TAs were generally unhelpful. An average of 10 questions had to be asked on Piazza per lab just to understand what the discussion questions were attempting to ask. An introductory English course like ENGL 109 should probably be required for these TAs.  ",
      "Pretty useful course for report writing in the future but very long and tedious. The reports were pages and pages long with practically 3 experiments combined into one. One of the reports was due over a week after final exams were finished which was not great. But TAs are very nice in person and they help you a lot when you ask them questions.",

      "Interesting course and not too difficult.",
      "I found the content pretty interesting. The exam had some trick questions that made it unnecessarily difficult but the actual concepts weren't too hard to grasp. ",
      "Subject itself is pretty interesting but course was extremely shallow and I barely learnt anything. Exams were difficult to score high grades for all the wrong reasons. Midterm was excruciating easy and content coverage was realistically crammable within 2h but there were so few questions for a large weighting such that mistakes magnified an incredulous amount (e.g. straight forward calculations that take ~5min can translate to ~5% of overall course grade). Final exam was full of mistakes and we were forbidden from asking any questions whatsoever. There was content prof explicitly said would not be covered. TAs were super nice and understanding of the situation but there was only so much they could do. Stopped going to lectures after the first two and just read textbooks. Course overall grades were not low but the experience was borderline unbearable. ",
      "Similar to what others have experienced content the prof explicitly said would not be covered showed up on assessments. Make sure you at least skim the textbook to be prepared for these questions. Not the worst course in terms of difficulty.",
      "THIS IS THEEEEE WORST COURSE I have ever taken and the most hated class in 2A for my cohort. The lectures were sooo\u2026\u2026\u2026.boring and useless, which motivated most of the class to never show up. The textbook is completely useless as well, just pages and pages of conceptual ideas, and then just a bunch of numerical calculations you have no idea how to do. Often, they require you to make wild assumptions or just happen to memorize certain values about a property you would normally look for in a chart. The book barely and I mean barely skims the topic and then it tells you to google the rest for yourself. The tutorials are literally questions from the textbook, which usually does not relate to what it spoke about. The labs were poorly designed; students are sometimes required to buy or search for household items to carry out the experiment. The lab manual always presents a cheap, flimsy experimental setup in the form of a picture with very little organized and comprehensible instruction on how to actually set it up and carry out the procedure, which just of course led to way too many experimental errors, and thus the least accurate data possible. Many large concepts that were repeatedly mentioned throughout the course didn't show up once on the exams. Meanwhile, memorizing random things like the type of material that reading lenses are made of is required for the test. Funnily enough, such random facts, are only shown one time, on this one slide, in this one lecture for a minute. There are even questions on the exam requiring you to use brand-new equations you've never used before, found somewhere on the slides, possibly in the tiniest writing, and with zero explanation as to what each variable in the equation means. So ultimately, even if you manage to self-teach yourself the entire course, you may still get royally screwed. To top it off this teacher will ask you to purchase anything for his class, including software with no notice. Day of the class, prof waltzes in, telling us we need to buy a peer grading software for $30 to submit our assignments, oh and the first assignment, which we were also just hearing about, was due the following day\u2026\u2026\u2026. the hell! Did you realize that I said, \u201cpeer grading software\u201d? So yes, students are marking and evaluating other students\u2019 work and providing feedback to those evaluations. In the end, the prof and Tas will still mark your work and bring down the grade that the students gave you. Thus making this platform a complete waste of your time and money, particularly since there are platforms that other teachers use at this school to do the same thing for free. No surprise that many students were failing his quizzes, especially when there were so few questions on the quiz to do in even lesser time. One question easily translates to 4.5% - 10% of your grade. What makes this better is that for calculation questions, you have to get the EXACT number in order to get the answer correct, so if you have 0.0025 and he has 0.0026, you just lost 10%.  Did I mention that if you cumulatively fail the quizzes, you fail the course? He will automatically fail you. All grades aside from the quiz grades become NULL AND VOID, they won\u2019t count towards your final average. So you, my friend would have double wasted your money on that software and all materials you bought for the labs, all the time and effort you spent doing the other course work would have been for nothing. Just in case you are hoping for a curve, get that out of your mind right now. THERE IS NO CURVE, however, you may be selected for an interview where you get 20 mins to make a speech, and/ or be grilled with questions about the different topics that made up the quiz you failed. If you do well on the interview, who knows, you may get 3% added to your failed quiz. This is a one-time thing, so I hope you won't fail more than one quiz and I for sure hope that if you do fail one that it was only like a 47% on that quiz. Enjoy. ",
      "If I didn't have mayer as my prof, this course would have been hella easy, fun and probably really useful. Sadly, I didn't learn much from this course and it was literally just to pass his course. \nThis course should have taught some pretty fundamental stuff that you'd use later on (ex picking biomaterials and stuff).",
      "The course would be good if it wasn't taught by the absolute definition of a horrible professor. I've never seen someone who looks like they hate teaching more than Mayer and it made classes almost unbearable. Basically taught myself everything because he just read off the slides in a sleep-inducing monotone voice. I really wish I was able to explore this subject more but instead, I was forced to teach myself only what I needed to pass. 2/3 of our class failed the midterm and we had a class average of 42%. Then the class after our grades came out Mayer had the audacity to tell us we should \"get together as a class and figure out how we can do better on the final\". No I'm not kidding. After our A-reps had to fight him for their lives we got the slightest curve. He has a condition that you have to pass the combined midterm/final to pass the course so a lot of people are now left in a bad spot for this final. Overall, if you are taking this course with Mayer, all I can say is good luck.",
      "This course teaches some pretty interesting and useful concepts but at the end of the day, all students want is to pass. The professor teaches in the most monotone voice, simply reading from slides and never emphasizing important topics. The lectures have no correlation to the tutorials while the tutorials have no correlation with the exams. Both the midterm and final included questions which were never taught during lectures and expected students to magically know equations never once mentioned in class. You can tell how much the professor hates the students and ultimately wishes them to do poorly. After a disastrous 23 page midterm, students begged the professor to make the final shorter as there is simply not enough time to complete all the questions. The professor responded by handing us a 32 page final. No curve was given and a good majority of the class failed. The TAs mark as if they have a passion for failing students awarding zero or simply one mark for several pages of work. Part marks seem to be a thing of the past. During tutorials, the TA mocks students for not knowing the answer to questions we have never seen before, tauntingly claiming that they will appear on our exam and we will fail. Ultimately, Waterloo University has taken a useful course and given it to the most awful professor they could find. "

The midterm included no multiple choice questions, comprised entirely of obscure short answer questions which were about small insignificant pieces of information written on one of the hundreds of slides. Any topics emphasized did not appear. With a 54% average on the midterm, the professor comes into class the next day blaming the students and suggesting we use this as motivation to \"study more\". The tutorials introduced new topics unrelated to lecture material, basically using this time to teach a whole new lesson which was testable. The study guide and lecture slides merely created confusion as to what to study from. Final grades were posted after the due date creating more stress for the students. Overall, easy concepts were taken and presented in such a manner that students would not be able to do well. "

      "Learned a vast variety of business concepts.",
      "Don't get how they mark the test ",
      "Pretty cool course. Learn some interesting stuff about the business world. Midterm and final are mostly memorization so make sure you have a good study technique for pure memory. The Labs and New Venture Project were excellent in my opinion. They help build actual skills as opposed to just teaching content (though they do a little bit of this as well). ",
      "I wish I didn't have to take this course, but every BBA student does. A few decent concepts, which should have taken 2 weeks not 4 months to cover. ",
      "Grades depend on TA. More useful than people give it credit, but overall not that useful..",
      "Terrible course",
      "Memorization based. Half the concepts are common sense, but might be hard to recall on an exam. Attend the lectures. ",
      "Didn't like it for the first have with all the cases and the midterm but I then I started to find it more interesting with the newer topics and I ended up enjoying new venture more than i thought i would",
      "Probably one of the most useful courses I have take in my undergrad. Course content is quite straightforward and not the most interesting. However, the group projects and presentations really build your soft skills like communication and working in groups, something very few other courses manage to do.",
      "I learned more during the labs than during the lectures as the lectures weren't very engaging. However, the SOS sessions and lab manual help a lot in terms of understanding content. ",
      "Labs are fun but the lectures are very dry. Make sure to go to SOS sessions and memorize the slides if you want an 80+ on the exams.",
      "Meh",
      "Learned a lot in businesses - most of em common sense tho, just in fancy vocab. Lectures are a waste but do go to labs and SI sessions. Way to much work than expected and the marking scheme is brutal. Not recommended if you don't have to take it.",
      "Do not take this course unless you absolutely have to. I have never taken a course that has such bad organisation.  If you do have to take this course realise that it is completely bullshit writing and totally subjective marking. Do not expect to get good marks unless you dedicate ridiculous amounts of time in office hours and can suck up to the TA. They mark everything extremely harshly and they do everything in their power to make it so that you lose marks (example: they do not share slides or examples of anything shown in labs even though we are suppose to make sure you follow that format for assignments). Lastly they treat students like they are in elementary school. I understand that it's a first year course but restricting electronics in class and having us do a bunch of stupid exercises that are pointless and a waste of time is just degrading. Really is too bad because they content is actually quite interesting. If you are interested in business I believe Waterloo offers some similar courses in the ECON and AFM faculties.",
      "You shouldn't be taking this class if you're not in Double Degree, it's too much of a timesink. The business concepts are mostly common sense and you'll get frustrated when marks get docked for inexact wording. Group projects can be either a blessing or hell, try to get into a Lab with all of your friends. Lectures are a waste of time, bring extra work or games with you. SI and SOS sessions will bless you before exams. ",
      "Teaches the fundamentals of the external environment to business. Case competition and New Venture are good projects that help apply what you're learning in lecture. GO TO SI SESSIONS!",
      "A lot of people hate this course since there are so many group projects and mandatory weekly labs, which is true, but I found the course enjoyable as it is useful and I can actually apply the knowledge to real life. Labs took me back to high school classes as the size was small and we could get to know our peers. I was very lucky to have my New Venture group members and we became good friends even after BU111. My TA was really nice as well, and she made the labs amazing.",
      "The worst course you could possibly take in first-year.\n\n\nLectures (during COVID) are synchronous online, but Carayannopoulos refuses to post lecture recordings! In fact, she records the lectures to share with TAs, but purposefully witholds the recordings from students and explicitly forbids anyone from recording the lectures. Furthermore, the online learning material she provides are INCOMPLETE slides that are deliberately missing information from the lectures. She's so wicked for this.\n\n\nNot to mention, the mandatory labs; if you miss 2 labs, you automatically FAIL THE COURSE. As a result, you are forced to waste 80 minutes in labs each week going over material that was already covered.\n\nYou DON'T GET FEEDBACK FROM MIDTERM; she purposefully does not give you any feedback at all on your midterm. As a result, not only are you unable to argue for marks, but you can't learn from your mistakes either! The whole point of a course is to learn. How are you supposed to learn if you don't know what you did wrong? \n\n\nOverall, Carayannopoulos does an immaculate job at countering student learning. I feel sympathetic for all students that have to go through this horrendous course. ",

It does her no harm, and it would've saved me hours if I could have watched the recorded lectures and skipped all the fluff (which is 80% of the content).",

Took back in fall 2018, but business is just explaining fancy words with common sense.\n\nYour entire experience is mainly from your new venture group and if you got a bad one like me, it's just not a good time. \n\nLabs were time-consuming with many useless reports/assignments.\n\nWeird how they teach you a bit of finance at the end as if the other 90% of the course was essentially teaching you fancy business words.\n\nThe new venture was just a long long long long long group project that made you hand in something every week. Couldn't believe I needed to do the same in BU 121\n\nJust hope you get a good new venture group",

Lab blocks absolutely killed it for me. I didn't like the TA and group work kind of sucked because of that. Midterm and quizzes are the same type as 111, assignments are of the same structure as well. Course is extremely TA dependent, you could have a blast if you have a good lab.",
      "Course was not too death but the assignments were all over the place",
      "Horrible course. Horrible prof. Assignments have no clear guidelines. You lose marks on things not because you didn't know how to do them well, but because you didn't know you had to do them. Laura always changed up the requirements last minute without informing everyone, and even the TAs weren't sure what was required until they actually had to grade it. Next, the learning assessments (aka tests). They either did not give us enough time to do the tests, or they marked them extremely unfairly. In Laura's eyes, \"uploading the reputation of the program\" means ensuring the course average stays low, not grading students based on their work. On top of all this, Laura decided not to record the lectures when the course was offered only online, so all students (including those living in different time zones) had to figure out a way to show up to lectures and listen to her talk for 3 hours a week. What makes it even worse is that the 3-hour lectures are probably only 30-45 minutes worth of content, the rest is her giving useless examples and going unbearably slow. I ended up doing well in the course, but still the worst course I took in first year. ",
      "course was not really hard at all. all of the necessary info for exams was literally in the course slides on MYLS so you theoretically could have never gone to class and merely read the slides and did perfectly fine on the exam. some assignments here and there that weren't bad and new venture project was very fun but that is heavily dependant on your group",
      "I found this course to be genuinely useful, especially as a CS student as it explained several concepts that would be helpful for making a startup. Compared to BU111, the marking was done better and the assignments were also not difficult. You can study for the course the night before and still probably pass it but I'd suggest attending the lectures despite how boring they might be as that'll help you do really well. Also make sure you don't miss the due dates at all, the work is really easy and instead of pushing it last minute and losing all the marks for the assignment due to late submission, it's better to just work early. Sofy was a good prof, decently engaging lectures and flexible with marks.",

One notable change to the course this year is that the New Venture group project was compressed into three weeks, which I think was too short. Laurier also added content on critical thinking and communication. \n\nThe course will continue to be overhauled for W24, including the potential removal of labs, so take these reviews with a grain of salt.",
      "The marking is very dependant on the IA. I was not a fan of the in-person \"quizzes\" for pre-lab, but it really forces you to catch up with the course and get familiar with the content way ahead of exams. It may seem like common sense, but they make it way more complicated than it needs to be. You will be fine if you practice finance and memorize ALL the slides for the final. Presentations are the same as BU111, tedious, but a great learning experience for various soft skills. ",
      "The course, and its content is very useful. Labs are much better than in BU111. I believe the course is changing every year but the content covered in  W23 was very useful and insightful. The assignments are fair and rather simple. The exams were very difficult. The marking scheme was unfair in the midterm but the final exam they seemed to figure it out."

I voted this course as easy because in terms of the other courses that you'll take in the semester, it is one of the easier ones.

Requires you to ask a lot of questions, attend lectures and really listen to the professor. Even after reviewing your notes, some assignment questions and tutorials will still stump you, but they are excellent for applying the content and preparing for the exam.\n\nMidterm and Final exams were similar to that of CHE100. Tough midterm where you dont have enough time (but fortunately prof curved up) and a final where f you studied correctly was generally much easier than anticipated. DO not undermine this course and use WEEF TA's and TA's for help when stuck on assignment questions (shoutout my boy Long, he goated fr).\n\nAlso, lab component to the course was one of the biggest PITA. Luckily 2 of the 4 reports you have to are done in groups (so choose your group wisely) and 1 of the 2 individual reports were only partial.

      "There are two aspects to CHE 102; course content covered before midterm, and content covered post-midterm. Let me start by outlining my experience regarding content covered in the days leading up to the midterm.\n\nDespite its unpopularity among undergrads, the midterm quiz contains only ten multiple choice questions, each worth 20, or 10 marks on the length of the question. Since the course content prior to midterms is centred around advanced stoichiometry that involves the setup of a system of linear equations to form the foundation for solving, it becomes increasingly difficult to make sense of how you are supposed to approach the questions on the quiz. A lot of them involve highly structured calculations where the chance of committing an error increase Due to the fact the entire quiz is multiple choice, even a minor error in calculation can lead you to the wrong final answer, which if included in the list of responses can deliver false hope. If not, you will end up spending 20 minutes trying to locate the error, which can be likened to finding a needle in a haystack. In case that ever happens you, MOVE ON TO THE NEXT QUESTION! Yes, you may have instantly pulverized 20 marks, but what can you do?\n\nThe course content after midterms is a whole different story. That is when the topics covered appear to be more relevant (to our program at least) and more straightforward to comprehend. Unfortunately, the final exam is still entirely multiple choice; a source of frustration for many, but our professors were generous enough to allow us to redeem ourselves by setting up a stupendously simple and straightforward final exam that allowed us to compensate for our poor performance on the midterm.\nFinally, the final is non-inclusive; the content covered during lectures leading up to midterms will not be included.\n\nTL;DR Course content prior to the midterms is seen to be somewhat challenging, and most undergraduates (including me) are obliterated once we receive our midterm grades.

Of my courses, CHE102 provides the most resources to prepare students for tests. ",

      "Course was taught fully online during F2021. Learning through Mobius modules was a disgrace-the content was presented in an unintuitive and boring way, and most of the time you were left scratching your head as to what you just read. Tests absolutley sucked as there was no part marks-you either got it right, or lost 5 points for every single MC. I struggled alot with this format as making one small mistake would cut off a couple percent each time. Glad its over. ",
      "The difficulty of this course completely depends on the quality of your high school chemistry teachers and curriculum. Most people find it straightforward, while others struggle quite a bit. CHE 102 is mostly high school review, with a touch of new concepts. Assignments and tests are slightly more demanding on problem-solving skills. But if you do the previous years' exams and practice tests, you should have no problem getting a decent grade. Not relevant to my degree, but I mildly enjoyed taking it.",
      "This course is unbelievable dry and boring if taken online through mobius. The lessons suck and are so hard to get through.

The tests were weighted so high but were pretty easy to do well on. Prof. Lowman is an absolute g.",

Goes into less depth than AP chemistry; assignments and tests were fairly straightforward, although the heavy calculations in some of the questions made it very easy to lose quite a few marks. Mobius lessons were unnecessarily long on the easy review concepts but tended to gloss over the more unintuitive ideas taught in the course, but the course in general was quite well-organized and exam prep was handled well with live sessions and multiple past exams. My section had in-person tutorials, and our prof was awesome about explaining the concepts properly and helping us work through some tougher problems.",

      "This course was slightly harder/more in depth than my grade 12 AP Chem course, but a lot of it was high school review. I find this course to be very particular in the way that the tests were delivered. The F21 delivery of the class had three tests which were purely MC. Taking them could be stressful, especially since there were no part marks given and we needed to pass the test component to pass the course.",
      "If you had a good Chemistry teacher in high school or friends that are good at chem you\u2019ll do just fine. The course is broken down into 6 sections, with an assignment due every 2-3 weeks. Each section had about 3-5 lessons which you review in weekly lectures, then an assignment and tutorial sessions. There were also 3 tests all term, each test was all multiple choice and covered two of the previous sections (1&2, 3&4, 5&6). As long as you keep on top of lectures and assignments, and when you don\u2019t understand continue to do more practice then you should pass this course.",

I would say the tests were fairly similar to the assignments so if you are good with assignments then you should be good for the tests. The prof I had was really bad tho, only 7 out of 100 students would attend lecture ",
      "Easier than IB chem so content was all review, and exams were all MC, the problem-solving process for some of the questions quite literally makes no sense so just familiarize yourself with the types of questions (by doing assignments and practice exams) and you'll be ok",

      "Brothers, it's mostly HS chemistry other than phase diagrams and VLE. Sure, almost none of you need it for your degree, but you might as well enjoy an easy course that allows you to focus on your other work. Also, buy a new iClicker from the campus store (it comes with a 5 year plan for the cellphone app), and return the iClicker. It's cheaper than buying a 4 year cellphone plan, and you don't need to deal with iClickers being absolutely awful/not connecting/breaking.",

      "Depending on your background, this course may be a lot of review from high school, but it also brings some new stuff as well. In order of difficulty for the units (from hardest to lowest): Phase Equilibrium, Electrochemistry, Gas Chemistry, Rates of Reaction, Chemical Equilibrium, and Stoichiometry. The M\u00f6bius assignments are not too hard in terms of difficulty, but they only allow 1 attempt which is annoying. Some profs used a lot of SLIDOS, which is a pain since you have to attend lectures, but other profs only used them for the first few weeks. The tutorials are also not too hard to complete considering the answers are given whilst the TAs mostly check for the process and completion. The midterm was reasonable in its difficulty (I started studying the night before and still got an 80%). The same goes for the final, you can study the whole course past midterms in only a few days and come out with 70%+. As far as the utility, unless you are in Chem Eng, this course is kinda useless.",
      "A pretty fair introductory chemistry course, focusing a lot on calculation and the math part of chemistry. Some may find it easy some may not. Attending lectures is not necessary but recommended (*attending sessions with good professors) if you are not good at chemistry or want to minimize the time you spent on this course (just reading the slides and trying to understand everything by yourself can be time consuming). ",
      "TA was great. I found the Mobius textbook to be a better version of the in-person lectures, as it generally covered the topics thoroughly and concisely. The course content itself was not too useful for SE, but I think I still learned a few things from it. I personally did not find it to be that easy, but was able to get a good final mark just from reading the Mobius textbook and doing the graded assignments.",
      "The course basically feels like math ft. the periodic table, as chemistry concepts are not a huge part of the course. I got 97 on the midterm and 94 on the final while barely paying attention in class or knowing many chemistry concepts.\n\nPro Tip: if it looks unsolvable, just bust out the matrix",
      "If you didn't learn ALL of the concepts in high school then this class is definitely challenging. A bad prof will demonstrate a bad grade. The 50% weighted exam average to pass the class was quite terrible, but it was nice with the amount of multiple choice they gave you.",
      "covid fucked up my gr 11 chem skills like stoic and gas laws so i did awful on the midterm. but then i grinded 3 days before the final and ended up with 85. it's not that hard of a course, u just gotta pay attention in class and watch youtube to do well.",
      "One of the easier courses of 1A, understand lecture and assignment questions and you're good. Not many tricks ",
      "The lectures are ok they are just really long and hard to keep up but the exams were fine. All that was required to pass was to identify the question and use the correct formulas on your cheat sheet which will guarantee you the right answer. Assignments are online and kinda stressful cause you only have 2 chances to get it right but they are manageable.",
      "Very crammable",
      "The way the midterm and exam is structured is really annoying. Most of it is multiple choice so if you make one small mistake, the entire question is wrong.",
      "If I were to sum up this course in one equation, it would be: PV=nRT. That's it, literally! Very easy introductory chemistry course, mostly a review of high school, with a few new elements (phase equilibrium, electrochemical cells, etc...). The course focuses heavily on gases, partial pressures, and equilibria. ",
      "Very poorly structured course. Online modules were very confusing and tutorials were unhelpful. I passed this course without really knowing what an ideal gas was.",
      "One of the harder courses in 1A for most people. Similar to high school chemistry, though you will likely never use many of the principles on a deep level for future courses.",
      "I took this course a year ago in 1A and I found it difficult. The online mobius teaching modules and multiple-choice exams were bad. The tutorials were not great, though I think it was my prof's first time teaching the course and he did get better as they went on. It felt like the exams and assignments were deliberately structured to be difficult, probably because the course was being taken not just by us civil engineers but also by other engineering departments that on average have higher levels of academic performance. I had to put a lot of work into this class to do okay!",
      "I enjoyed the class and found it engaging. I haven't been a fan of chemistry in the past, but in this class I really enjoyed it. I have to say tho that most of this was only because of the prof Mary Robinson, she is so delightful and makes hard topics easy to understand.",
      "It was easy for me, but others found it challenging. After midterms I never attended his lectures and I just did the work at home since everything was on the slides anyways which the prof read off of.",
      "useless course with stupid calculations",
      "Whenever I tell people I'm taking Chem as a software they ask me why. You tell me.",
      "The course was well structured but my professor wasn't so it cancelled out; it was frustrating. Would review slides and questions outside of class if you want a good mark. \n\nLeads to a couple of civil courses in wastewater, though UW flow says they are also equally mandatory and useless though."

If you took them in high school, the course wont be such a drag but don't underestimate post midterm as thats when the course begins to ramp up. Midterm was super easy and as a consequence the final was quite difficult. But if you take plenty of time to prepare (at least 5 days in advance) then you can do well on the final too. Overall an interesting course, introduces you to how mathematics (yes there is math, and no it isn't difficult) and biology are used together. "

      "CHEM 120 was an extension of grade 12 chemistry and delves a little deeper into thermochemistry, gases, and also theory behind bonding. The course consisted of a couple of assignments and participation quizzes and two midterms and an exam. There were four attempts at each assignment, and a score of 80 or above would be counted as 100, so it was easy to get 100 on all the assignments. The midterms were very straightforward as they outline the material that they will be testing you on. If you do the practice problems assigned, you will likely do very well on the midterms. The exam is mostly on the latter half of the course and not too difficult, but it is important to be able to do problems from the earlier half of the course quickly so that you do not run out of time. It was also interesting that they announced the option to have the final count for 100 per cent of the course should you do better on the exam than in the course and it soured the fact that I had done well on the two midterms and assignments, but I digress. Interesting material but a lot of reading is required for the latter half of the course to grasp the quantum side of the course.",
      "Easy course ever",
      "The course if easy if you practice the course content. About half of the course can be considered review from previous schooling years. There is an extra layer of depth to the material. As a Chem major I found this was a fun course.",
      "Really good course - the most interesting one of my 1A term. Easy to do well, as long as you stay on top of the content and make sure you understand the concepts. If you did well in 12U chem and are willing to put in the work, CHEM120 can be an easy mark booster. Tons of opportunities for bonus/participation marks and the midterms were the easiest I had. The \"Easy\" half of 12U chemistry covered by first year courses. Don't take it with Mikkelsen though.",
      "This course covered a significant amount of material, a siginificant portion of which was rushed in the last few weeks of the semester. It is definitely possible to succeed in this course if you keep up with the material and review the practice questions in the textbook. The mid-term exams are very time crunched with only 50 minutes to complete 16 questions, however, sufficient time was provided to complete each of the questions on the final exam. ",

      "First midterm was very bad for time. Second midterm was very easy. Exam was fair. ",
      "CHEM 120 is a course that basically all science students have to take. There are 2 midterms and a final. The first midterm is about stoichiometry, which is essentially a lot of calculations and formulas. The 2nd midterm is more theory based and is about things like Lewis structures and periodic trends. The midterms were both also out of very little (1st was out of 12, 2nd was out of 16 or 18 iirc), so it can be a little annoying but they were both VERY fair. The content itself can be a little hard to grasp at time, but with practice you will understand. There's also a ton of practice problems available in the course notes and online assignments. Make sure to do the practice problems (especially the ones in the sample midterm) and really understand them because they are often times VERY similar to the ones found on the midterms. The profs for this course will often do review sessions before the midterms and finals, and it's a good idea to attend them because they will go over questions and it's a good opportunity to clarify things you don't understand. They also all record their lectures which is very nice. There is also quite a bit of grade 12 review.  If you're thinking about being a keener and buying the textbook, DON'T! Save yourself the money and buy something else!!!! I bought it and barely opened it because we already had so many practice problems available to us. The course notes are basically all you need, and if you have Prof. Sciani, his powerpoint notes are very good too.",
      "as a physics major i hated every part but quantum chemistry",
      "Kristina Lekin was awesome, really wanted to help you learn. Students from other sections came to her lecture time instead. The content was not too heavy, midterms and exam were fair. Not useful because I dont have to take chemistry again, but a better experience than I expected.",
      "not bad, just make sure you practice what you dont understand! bc if u dont know it, u dont know it ",
      "If you're taking this course Lekin is an amazing prof and is very clear with her explanations of concepts. Bissonnette and Sciaini are great too, but they both post their lectures online as well if you ever need clarification. Participation is 5% of your mark in Lekin's class, and you could choose to either participate in clicker question sessions every Friday or do the online participation quizzes online. She typically would post a video the night before Friday's lecture and make it a very interactive lecture which was a nice way to learn. Online assignments are 10% of your mark, which you can opt out of and have the weight of them transferred to your final exam, however they closely resemble a lot of midterm questions and enhance your understanding so I would recommend you just do them. You get 4 attempts and if you get above 80% they count it as 100%. Easy way to earn 10% of your grade. The first midterm was worth 12% and people typically tend to do worse on because Module 0 isn't covered as heavily in class and is review. The second midterm is 18% and was significantly easier (I was one mark away from perfect) but is much more theory based rather than calculation. The final is worth 55% and I considered it to be fair. I would not recommend buying the textbook for this class, even when I tried to make use of it, the additional review material in the course notes and posted online by profs had it beat. The course notes are by far enough to get you through this course. :)",

      "Just an expansion on high school chemistry. I took Chem 12 in grade 11, so hardest part for me was remembering stuff from that long ago.",
      "This is a mandatory course for all undergrad BSc students. It is comprised of 2 midterms and a final which are all very fair. Often, the first midterm is mainly on high school review and modules 0-1 from the course notes whereas the 2nd midterm is more based on new contents, so modules second half of 1-4.  The content itself is pretty easy to understand assuming that you have a great understanding of the concepts taught in grade 12 , but if not is also easy to grasp with practice. This class is designed to ensure that students do their best in this course and can be seen through the various questions provided from multiple assignments, online quizzes and clicker questions done throughout the course. BEFORE EACH MIDTERM AND FINAL EXAM: Make sure to do the practice sample midterm/ final exam questions provided on Learn as they are very similar (like 95%) TO the ones on the midterms.  There are also various ways to get help when you do not understand a certain material. The profs for this course also have review sessions before finals, and it's a good idea to attend them because they will go over questions and it's a good opportunity to clarify things you don't understand. They also all record their lectures which is very nice.  \n\nDISCLAIMER; \n\nDO NOT BUY A TEXTBOOK FOR THIS CLASS. I bought just the textbook and not the solutions manual and I did not even open it ONCE. The course notes and the practise questions provided by these profs are enough!!",
      "Chemistry was never my favourite subject but man did this course change my opinion!! I had Prof Tsen and he was very good at teaching the material. I did find that for hard material he didn't \"dumb it down\" (which I sometimes need) so I found watching Dr Ingram's vids veryyyyyy helpful. I LOVE that she does clicker questions so that you're actively recalling the material (honestly the best study method, look into it) and you can really see where the holes in your knowledge are. The first test was a bit tough (got a 60 something) but after keeping up with the course notes, reviewing and most importantly doing the assignments, I managed to bring my mark up to an 80! ",

      "Very easy course. I took it online and there were weekly online assignments worth 3 % each, weekly participation quizzes and 2 hand written assignments. The final was multiple choice questions. If you took high school chemistry this is an easy 90.  Even without, the course isn't that hard if you put in the effort.",
      "The course is very well structured and organized, and the course notes are extremely comprehensive. However, you WILL struggle if you've never done high school chemistry before, as it does assume is pretty generous amount of previous knowledge. It's all multiple choice (but this might change soon for chem students) so it's fairly easy to do well without knowing everything.",
      "most of the content in this course is from grade 12 chemistry. there are course notes you can get and annotate during class. there are online assignments that you can do and participation marks which get you a free 15% of your grade. both midterms were pretty fair, and can be done well if you know your stuff. average for first midterm was in the high 60s and second midterm was in the 70s. laura ingram was AMAZING as an instructor for this course. she explains concepts very well, easy to approach and asks questions, and genuinely cares about how her students do. the final was also very fair, 60 MC questions; know your stuff and you can easily pull 90s in the course.",

      "I am a first year biology student who took this course in fall 2019. As someone who regularly went to class, I did not find this course too difficult. Some of the concepts overlapped from high school, while others were new but still relatively simple. The course notes were extremely useful and I definitely recommend buying them. However, I did not buy the textbook and personally did not think I would have needed it at all. There were biweekly assignments which closely followed what was done in class and were great to use later study guides. The tutorials were also useful study tools. I also recommend doing the participation quizzes, they are very simple and allow you to get the participation marks. All the resources are available to do very well in this course if you put in the effort. The midterms and exams were also very fair. Overall this course was pretty useful and easy and I enjoyed it!",

The textbook is a life-saver for making sure you know concepts, however, it is not as helpful for theory questions, and those are important! Overall, you can do well if you put in the effort.\n\nSpecial Mention: Professor Hopkins' lecture videos were very entertaining if you're taking the course online.",
      "I think this class could have been harder especially if you were in Marta's class, he taught well and people from other classes often went to his lectures.",
      "The course is absolutely unorganized fo people who don't have a strong chem background this might be scary but you will struggle if you haven't seen quantum numbers before and the professors were really bad at explaining; ps: CAN THE PROFESSORS PLEASE STOP TONGUE CLICKING DURING VIDEOS IT DRIVES ME AND A LOT OF STUDENTS CRAZY AND WE CAN'T FOCUS AT ALL JUST DON'T FORCE US TO HEAR UR SALIVA EVERY 3 SECONDS ? ",
      "I took this course online, and taught by all 3 profs: Hopkins, Ingram and Tsen. They all have different approaches when teaching this course; it is just a matter of adjusting to their teaching style.\n\nOverall an easy course with a small expansion on SCH 3U from high school. Do NOT make the mistake I did and think that reading course notes, doing assignments and participation challenges are enough, especially if chem is a weaker subject.\n\nDO THE TEXTBOOK QUESTIONS, BUY THE TEXTBOOK. IT will help you a lot (in fact, a lot of the questions on the midterms were either similar to or exactly the same as the questions in the textbook). Furthermore, take advantage of the Piazza website, you can get answers from other students or the instructors in a matter of minutes.",
      "Honestly, this course isn't that bad. this is coming from someone who absolutely hated sch4u in grade 12, i actually felt like this course was interesting. i would say there's a lot of building on things you learned in grade 12, plus a few new things, but in my opinion so long as you put in the work and try not to procrastinate (since the way the course is structured it's really easy to fall behind, at least during COVID times) you'll probably be fine. my best advice is to get help if you need it, there's so many upper years willing to help since they know this time is tough for you, so reach out for help if you need someone to help explain things a bit for you.",
      "go to every. single. lecture. write it all down all of it !!!!!",
      "Pretty easy rehash of grade 12 chemistry.",
      "A very controversial class in regards to its difficulty, but in all honesty, a majority of it is Gr 11-12 review. KEEP YOUR NOTES FROM THESE GRADES. I took this class online during COVID-19 and watched maybe 5 of the lectures and rest I caught onto from Gr 11-12 notes and the course notes provided. I personally did not use the textbook other than to cite and reference for 120L and to study for the exam. The course is scary and a little intimidating, but push through; it is absolutely possible to pass with 90%+. I was close with an 89%. Midterms and exam were alright, I found the exam easier than all the midterms. Be sure you understand your stoichiometry and all things quantum (VSEPR, orbitals, hybridization, etc.). Good luck!",
      "*Taken remotely due to COVID* Make sure to keep up with the content, there are several professors for this course and they each have their own teaching style that varies drastically. Some professors don't even use the course notes, they just make their own things that hardly coincide with the notes, but the course notes contain the content that is actually tested.",
      "The content is not really that hard but the profs seem to overcomplicate it and go over everything we don't need to know rather than teaching the stuff we do need to. There was one prof that kept talking about the history of chem rather than explaining the lessons. ",
      "First of all, shoutout to Scott Hopkins for the best Module Videos - he made me fall in love with Chemistry.\n\nThis course is pretty easy if you've done Chemistry in high school before.  The course content is structured really well and the video are amazing in helping you learn. Plenty of examples, and the assessment structure for this course is pretty good as well. Overall, really recommend this course for any non-science major looking to take up a science elective!",
      "Yikes",
      "The content isn't too difficult, and the lectures are pretty clear. The tests are where all the difficulty comes from",
      "Did it online, would highly recommend not doing so (if you have the choice, of course). The online version had optional weekly challenges and optional assignments. These questions were very good prep or the midterms/exam, and they take weight off the midterms/exams, so would highly recommend taking advantage.",
      "Started off with review from high school, but if you didnt already know that stuff or didnt remember it, it wouldve been difficult as it was pretty brief. This course was probably more difficult for me than it needed to be because i got a behind on lectures and didnt take the time to do practice questions. would recommend putting the effort in",
      "Good course! But hardest first year course in science I think. This course is not necessarily easy but they're tons of resources to make it manageable. The grading scheme helps a LOT with bumping up your grades if you fall short in the midterms and final. I got smoked by the final but was able to scrape 80s from all the participation challenges and assignments. Even though these are optional, I highly recommend doing them.",
      "This course was somewhat difficult, passed with a B+. There are 2 major tests (both worth 20%) and a final exam (worth 40%) and the remaining 20% is participation challenges and assignments. Majority of your grade depends on how well you do on the 2 midterms and exam so you REALLY got to make sure that you are well prepared before the tests becauses its a big chunk of your grade. The first 3 units were terrible, but the all other units were basically grade 12 chemistry with small new pieces of information, so those units weren't difficult. Piazza was really helpful and really got me through this course, it's a great platform to asks questions so I would suggest using that. This is the type of courses were you need to spend at least 2 weeks prior to a test reviewing all the units, you can't cram last minute, that doesn't work for this course, you seriously need to know your stuff so use the tools they provide, don't be scared to email the prof or TAs about questions, and ask peers for help. If you do all of that, you'll do well in this course",
      "Textbooks honestly not needed, but if your a workaholic and have the spare time you could do some stuff from it I guess, but definitely would not stress. I got a low 90 in the course overall without touching the textbooks, and 100% on the first midterm and a mid 90 on the second (and the second midterm I could have got 100 on I just had a few clumsy mistakes that were just caused by misreading questions). The final exam I got a 90 on and unfortunately I couldnt see what I did wrong for that as they dont release what you got right and wrong on mobius like they did for the tests so thats unfortunate but still a 90 is a good mark, I assume I might have made a few clumsy mistakes like with the 2nd test. ALSO make sure to do all the participation challenges and assignments on time (regardless of whether or not the assignments are due at the end of the term) as they were super useful for the tests and exams (AND I REALLY MEAN THEY WERE SUPER USEFUL). Make sure to question everything you dont understand and dont be afraid to reach out on piazza or even message a prof to try and expand your knowledge. I even was able to schedule teams meetings (with Dr Sciana shoutout to him). As for the extra practice at the ends of screencasts I would actually HEAVILY RECCOMEND don't stress a ton to feel the need to do them immediately, but rather actually preferably leave them until you start studying for tests/exams as they will be new questions on content that you might have forgot a bit about and then they will be great study tools to help test your knowledge as you dont have that sorta possibility to get them right simply by remembering what you were did before (you actually have to think because you havent done them before whereas things like the assignments you already did in the past). Additionally obviously when studying re-do the participation challenges and assignments multiple times, and with all these tips you will 100% thrive.",
      "Pretty easy course overall, but lacks practice problems. Lots of opportunities to boost your mark. I don't like how answers are not disclosed for incorrect attempts for practice assignments.",
      "Did not enjoy the course much but did well. Just stay up to date and it will be fine",
      "I took this course in Fall 2021. The content and weekly participation challenges were easy to follow along. But, in my opinion, they did not prepare you for the assignments and midterms. I would feel ready after looking over the content videos and slides but once I'd start the midterm, questions that were never in practice would show up. ",
      "Ingram is a great prof - made content engaging and easyish to follow. Mainly a high school review of chem but a few extra stuff as well",
      "Requires a good amount of practice and time, but the course is set up in a way to help you succeed if you are willing to put in the effort. ",
      "Took it online with Laura's videos which were super helpful whenever I was stumped. Follow the course notes, try questions, and consult videos/ask for help when you're stuck, and you'll be fine (if they offer this online again).",
      "If you pay attention in class and at least try to do some of the homework (and ALL the assignments online, these are the most important), you'll be fine.",
      "I really liked this course, the material was interesting and Dr. Ingram was my best lecturer this term. I felt like she was truly invested in our learning. Though it wasn't super easy it's a lot of repeat from highschool, which is a good refresher since COVID-19 sent us online. Good course!",
      "CHEM 120 is difficult if you don't put the work and extra practice outside of class in. Good review in the first unit, then some newer concepts. Do yourself a favour and go to tutorials/ask for help when you need before it's too late. ",
      "Pretty much a highschool review course. I found it very fun, the participation challenges and assignments were useful for test prep. ",
      "Go to lectures and you'll be set!",
      "Most of this course, other than 1 or 2 modules (units), are a review from grade 11 and 12 high school chemistry, with some extra information added on. The modules go by at a relatively fast pace, but it is not impossible as long as you attend lectures and tutorials when necessary. I personally never used the textbook since I never had the time to, but I genuinely don't think it is necessary. The instructors have assignments, participation challenges (assignments that are timed), and their own extra practice worksheets and I found those to be more than enough practice. You'll definitely learn a lot but it is a really well structured course that sets you up for the fundamentals of chemistry! ",
      "The tests could be pretty hard but the assignments and participation challenges were easy.",
      "The majority was high school review, however, it takes time to adjust to your professors' solutions. The course moves at a very fast pace which can easily become overwhelming. The tests were difficult especially test 1 which had many calculations in 50 minutes. Most of the lecture content was explained in the pre-class videos with the exception of some of the example questions. The assignments were fairly straightforward and you had multiple attempts but the participation challenges were more challenging.",
      "Prof Fernandez was absolutely the best and Dr. Ingram really structured the course so students can do the best they can. Course content is mainly review from grade 11 and 12, plus the addition of new content which was fine. Office hours are also extremely helpful when concepts aren't clear in class as they do the questions with you. There's also lots of review sessions before the final exam which are hosted by the TAs!",
      "This course (Fall 2022) is designed in a hybrid style. There is a pre-class video to watch every day that covers background information and then in-class examples are done to understand the concepts. 10% of your grade is online assignments, these help you learn the material and if you get an 80% or above on each, you get 100%. Also, 10% of your grade is participation in challenges and in class (another easy way to boost your grade). There are 2 term tests (20% each), the first was was difficult (first exam of University) but the second one was easier. The exam is worth 40% and is relatively easy if you have studied and done the work all semester. Overall, the course is designed so you can succeed and the 50-minute classes are optimal so you don't get bored.",
      "Laura does a good job of teaching for this course. It's pretty easy to do well if you try hard and took grade 11 and 12 chem.",
      "I really liked how this course was organized. The mixture of pre-class videos, reviewing and learning content in-person, and going through full solutions to practice problems really helped enforce my understanding. I felt that the way that the assessments were set up to help students become successful if they put in the right amount of effort. A great transition for first-years who spent most of high school learning online during the pandemic to learning in a hybrid style in university. ",
      "This course was very organized and structured to let us succeed if we put in enough effort. The midterms were a slap in the face, but it is good to get that reality check early on in time for the exam. You have to put in a considerable amount of work to achieve the grades you want, of course. And Laura purposely structured the course that way to make it fair. Speaking of, Laura is an amazing prof. She explains exceptionally well, she gives us a lot of opportunities to practice with the participation challenges and assignments. She really wants us to succeed, thankfully. Whatever you do, try to get her as your prof. It is intimidating to ask her questions sometimes, but she does explain concepts exceptionally well. Additionally, the content was some high school reviews and the rest is building on those concepts. It doesn't take a lot to understand the problems, you just have to be confident in answering them. Best tip: PRACTICE!!",
      "honestly one of my favourite courses but u need to put in effort to see good results. structured very well in that there was a pre-class video to understand the theory (~ 15 mins per video) and in class, prof did practice questions that will most likely appear on the tests. attend tutorials to see different variations of questions that will appear on tests and participation challenges (pc). 10% online assignments (3 tries, 80%+ rounds to 100%) + 10% pc + 20% test 1 + 20% test 2 + 40% final exam. f22 first test everyone was given an extra mark for curve but first test can be dropped and replaced with final if it was done better",
      "Great course. Challenging enough to be engaging, although enough review of high school chemistry to be easy enough to be relaxed. If you did well in high school chem, you will be fine. If you didn't have chem in high school then it will still be ok, they do a lot to help you in this class. ",
      "This course was extremely well-taught. The teaching team consisted of three professors who all seemed to be on the same page. The professors attended help sessions before each of the two midterms worth 20% each and also before the final exam worth 40% of your grade. The course is designed to help you achieve a good mark and reinforce your understanding of the content. If you get 80% or higher on the weekly assignments, it's considered 100% when calculating your final grade and you get up to 3 times to do each assignment to ensure you get above 80%. Also, participation challenges are a timed one-hour slot that you have to answer questions and you get your actual grade plus half higher. For example, if you got 70% on a participation challenge, you didn't receive 30% (out of 100%), so you'd be \"reimbursed\" 15%, making your adjusted grade for that challenge 85%. Also, if you flunked the first midterm (like many people did...don't worry, the second midterm was easier), the professors transfer the weight of the lowest midterm to the final if you did better on the final. So under normal conditions, the final is 40% of your final grade and each midterm is 20%. If you got a 55% on the first midterm but you got an 80% on the final exam, that 80% would now constitute 60% of your final grade in the course instead of the original 40% because you did better. This was amazing of the professors, they really want to see you do well. Also, they post practice midterms and final exams before assessments so you can time yourself when you do them like you're in a real test situation. Very organized course and I would definitely recommend it to anybody remotely interested in chemistry. Good luck!",
      "Chemistry isn't usually my favourite subject but I quite enjoyed this course and I think that's all thanks to Laura Ingram. She has a very organized structure of the course, and there are multiple pathways to find help (drop in tutoring, office hours, tutorials). She also explains concepts quite clearly and is passionate about her field. I preferred her to my assigned prof, so just watched the videos she'd post. I got a 68 on the first midterm, finished the course with a 94. Do all the assignments and participation challenges, they will only help your grade. I'd also advise against leaving assignments until the due date (at the end of the term) as they are very useful when preparing for the midterms.",
      "I really enjoyed this course mainly because of the professor. She was super clear and helpful and I enjoyed attending her lectures. The assignments are really helpful for review and the practice midterms and exam were incredibly helpful as well, and enough to study off of without having to go look for other resources. Overall a totally fair course. Only complaint was that the TAs in the tutorial frequently got assignment questions wrong and didn't seem to understand the questions. ",
      "The format was clear. The assignments were generous, the participation challenges were easy, and the exams were all multiple choice. \nAs a person who did well in Grade 12 Chemistry years ago, this was an easy course.",
      "Great course structure, gotta give props to Dr. Laura Ingram for making this course doable despite the lackluster professor I had. Great online resources that we had easy access to on Learn. All instructors were easily available via office hours and email as well.\n\nThe only bad part about this course was the tutorials. They just reiterated the example questions covered in lectures or answered questions.",
      "enjoyed the course, mostly review from grade 12 for me not a lot of new content if the content is new to you definitely pay attention though",
      "I loved Chem 120. Overall Great course, it is like one step up from high school so its not too bad. As long as you do the work you will do well. My Prof Kristina Cvrkalj is great. If you get her you are a lucky student.",
      "This course is mostly expanding on high school content. There were a couple new things but as long as you practice you'll be fine. "

      "The labs were very straight forward. A good tip is always to read the lab over a day before the actual lab.",
      "the ta's are picky about the labs, but very enjoyable and easy course",
      "The pre-lab quizzes and procedure summary force you to prep prior to the lab, so theoretically you should have an idea of what each experiment is like prior to even coming in.  The experiments line-up well with the CHEM 120 course content, and acts as a reinforcer of key course ideas. ",
      "Course is overall pretty easy! The biggest thing that got me was significant digits! Make sure you double or even triple check all your values! For every incorrect significant digit, you lose 1/2 a mark. The exam was also surprisingly difficult for the course. Required much more knowledge of the labs procedures than expected!",
      "Great Hands on chemistry work. Lab reports were marked fair. The only tough thing was the final exam",
      "The labs were pretty interesting, but reports could be tedious and boring to write. ",
      "The labs weren't too difficult and pretty fair to be honest. Just make sure you ask for help if you don't understand something because you will need to be sharp for the final exam!",
      "A good start to labs, have to put in the work to see results but since the lab is biweekly more than enough time to get things done and do well. ",
      "I found the labs fun. The reports that are semi-formal are easy and lead you through the steps necessary to calculate meaningful values. ",
      "Possible to do very well! Talk to your TA to ensure you have what they want in your reports since they are the ones who mark your reports. ",
      "The course is pretty useful in doing lab work, but the lab reports are a lot of work.",
      "Many of the experiments were ones from high school done more in depth. Lab write-ups took a lot of time and effort. Final exam was surprisingly harder than the lecture exam. Make sure you know your lab safety and how to do all calculations in a short period of time.",
      "The experiments were all very easy to conduct, and interesting as well. The lab guide really made this course easy, you will make great use of it for each lab.",
      "The experiments are pretty easy to do and the lab reports aren't hard either. You get two weeks to complete the report. The final was MC and wasn't too hard. Just memorize what you did in the labs!",

      "This lab was pretty fun but the exam was quite difficult! When they say memorize the chemical formulas, DO IT! ",

      "The lab was straightforward and interesting. The experiments we did were relevant to what we learned in CHEM 120 and were somewhat interesting. It was fun to work with my partner and have some fun doing the experiments, my TA was nice and the mood of the lab was very relaxed. There were some hiccups when some experiments were a little drawn out and it looked like it would take forever to finish a particular experiment (particularly the titration experiment) and there was quite a bit of time invested writing out a procedure and doing pre-lab quizzes. The course consisted of five labs, each with a pre-lab quiz to be completed 24 hours ahead of the scheduled lab session, writing out the procedure for the lab before starting the experiment, and a lab report. Only one of the lab reports was formal (which took about a dozen hours to finish) and it was not too bad, although I do not recommend pulling off an all nighter to finish it like I did. The lab exam was fairly challenging so I would recommend practicing sample calculations for it. All in all, it was a good lab course.",
      "The lab is very useful in learning how to properly use lab equipment and follow laboratory procedures. If you take the time to understand each experiment beforehand, the experiments are straightforward. Overall I found being in the lab a fun experience.",
      "The course is interesting and the lab experiments were enjoyable! A lab report must be completed for each of the labs, which is fairly time consuming, however, you have two weeks to complete each report so it is manageable. Unfortunately, the final lab exam was extremely challening. ",

      "It's just a basic chem lab, nothing much to it. Do well on the labs and you can screw up the exam a bit more. The pre lab quizzes are really easy and the TA's are mostly helpful. Read the lab before hand and show up on time and you'll be fine. Sue is a great instructor I really enjoyed her.",
      "Sue is awesome. The class is very straight forward and there's little room for error. Make sure you don't start lab reports on the last day, you will have questions. Sign up for a lab during the 2nd week, so you can get help from your other classmates easier. ",
      "Bird, but fun and informative. ",
      "This lab was really easy. The online quizzes are simple if you have your lab manual with you, can easily be finished in less than 5 minutes. The lab reports are simple and all material to do well on them is laid out clearly in the manual. Sue is a great lab instructor, explains labs really well. Choose your lab partner wisely, labs that require a lot of steps take a while and can easily be screwed up if you're the only one doing the work of the two of you. ",
      "This course can be easy if you put in the proper effort \nYou have 2 weeks to do your lab reports, use that time!\nTA's are very good, they can help clarify concepts and answer questions.

It's the same day as the CHEM 120 exam, with 120 being in the morning and 120L being at night. Honestly, I only studied for this exam after the 120 exam, and I still did fine. Just read over the lab manual a few times and it won't be bad at all. ",

      "There are easy pre-lab quizzes composed of only 6 questions MC per quiz. You do have to do some work before each lab and after the lab. Easy marks can be attained from the lab reports assuming that you follow the instructions stated in the manual itself. Make sure you do not forget units. The final exam for this lab was so easy and required very little studying. It is on exactly what Sue says it's on and is on the same day as the lecture exam- lecture in the morning and lab in the evening. At the end of this course, you mark gets adjusted based on other TA's section average which is nice if your TA is a hard marker compared to your friends.",
      "Like many other labs, this one is highly TA dependent. I always got 95+ on the lab reports but keep in mind that they do adjust the marks higher or lower depending on the course average. Everyone says that the exam is hard but I didn't find it so because as long as you read over the lab manual, watch the technique vids on LEARN and know HOW to do the calculations you did in your lab, you're pr much set. Ended this course with an 87",
      "Pretty simple labs, a good intro to university chemistry labs. Learned a lot of lab skills and lab report writing techniques. Exam was fair, a bit trickier than the post lab reports.",

      "the actual lab experiments themselves are easy. however, in the post lab reports it is easy to mess something up and lose quite a few marks and hurt your grade from it. sue stathopulos is one the nicest instructors you will meet. super clear and engaging and very approachable in her office. she made videos explaining how to perform certain lab techniques which i recommend you watch before doing the experiments so you know what to do and how to do it correctly. most people find the final for this lab course very difficult, but it generally is not too bad if you study the labs and lab techniques used.",
      "Learned a lot of lab skills. The lab room used for this course is really nice (STC 4019) and the course itself is super well organized.",
      "I am a first year biology student who took this course in fall 2019. I personally thought that the labs were very useful as they allowed the students to obtain a lot of hands on experience and techniques. For each lab, an experimental procedure summary and an online assignment was due before the lab. A lab report was also due following each lab. The labs in general were often very time consuming but not extremely difficult. There was only one formal lab in total. In general the labs were enjoyable!",
      "This class forces us to KNOW the content being taught, you can't cheat your way through these labs. But honestly, I'm quite enjoying working on them.",
      "Cried a lot lol",
      "With it being online, this course is intense to say the least. Sue is great, no doubt about that it's just the assignments aren't as well explained and there aren't any office hours with your TA. I had to email my TA 3 times in order to get a reply back on a question I had. I like the BIO130L structure better; weekly office hour meetings that explain what to look out for in the lab reports and quizzes. ",
      "I do not intend to be a chemist or be in a chemistry lab in the future, but this course teaches you how to write lab reports and also has fun experiments (if done in real life I would imagine). The class adopted to COVID the best too imo, if you want to study chemistry you will like this ",
      "This class was extremely well organized. The experiment videos were super clear and left you understanding exactly what you need to know. Way better than BIOL 130L! Also, Sue is amazing and super nice. ",
      "Overall a well-structured course (much better than BIOL 130L). Your mark in this class is heavily dependent on your TA. Even if you do poor, however, there are tons of opportunities to boost your mark. For instance, the weekly participation challenges, as well as the bonus pre-lab assignment at the end of the term. The course was adjusted very nicely for online learning, and Sue went above and beyond to be able to give students a decent lab experience through the lab videos. ",
      "my TA was so mean, he removed marks for such stupid reasons and my mark suffered. Sue however, i thought was really nice. the lab tests are brutal, most people i talked to either failed or were close to failing the 2nd one. the labs themselves, really not bad. 4/5 were just about stoichiometry and unit analysis and there was only 1 full report during the semester and even then it was super short (unlike the 10-15 page mess of BIOL 130L). the course content itself is not bad and u don't really learn much that's new other than the use of new tools and lab techniques. ",
      "it was fun just took forever sucks to have them on fridays when you wanna go home so try to switch to earlier in the week. ask the ta and prof exactly how to calculate the lab questions and lab instructions. ",
      "Although the lab tests were difficult, I enjoyed and if I must say, perhaps loved the class. Amazingly organized for the COVID-19 online era with a cheerful, passionate professor. At the beginning of the term, it will feel as if the workload is heavy, but you\u2019ll get into the groove quickly. With good time management, you could be complete with the week\u2019s work by Tuesday with content posted on Monday. It can be annoying dealing with the weekly bonus participation challenges but push through and just do it! The marks will be worth it! Your future self will thank you. I did not complete the final ~3-4% bonus assignment at the end of the term and I lowkey regret it. Could have finished with a 95% rather than a 91%. A lot of your marks will come from your TA as they grade your weekly labs. Shoutout to my TA, loved him! Be sure to email your TAs with mistakes you find in their markings, it can get you lots of 100s. ",
      "Was very straightforward, essentially using a lot of the easier components of Chem 120, bit I really enjoyed it. Sue Stathopulos is wonderful, and you can tell she's very passionate about science and teaching. I had it online for COVID and she did a good job at keeping it as engaging as possible for the situation.",
      "I did this online, however i found it engaging. It was daunting at first, as a first year, but as soon as you get the hang of it, it is interesting! make sure you keep good notes on the the labs for the lab tests!",
      "So stressful",
      "It's been 2 months since this course ended for me and I miss watching the demos. Workload was fair for a half-credit course, everything was laid out clearly, and lots of bonus marks were given. It's possible to get 100 in this course!",
      "Of all the online classes I've taken so far, this one is probably the best. This course seems to have been adapted very well to the online learning platform, since most of the content was very well organized on LEARN. Sue Stathopulos is amazing, I've had a great TA so far. The lab test was the only thing that brought my mark down but only because I didn't study very well for it. I would just recommend studying for the lab tests thoroughly and to avoid finishing the pre lab assignments the day of. Overall, probably my favourite course so far!",
      "This course was insanely easy. Everything was laid out for you.",
      "Although I took this course online in Fall 21 the Instructor made it very intuitive and made the best out of the situation. By far one of the best online courses I took during the pandemic, and am lookin forward to CHEM 123 in person with the same prof.",
      "Useful for Chem students, and the way the labs were done is better than anything you'll find for COVID labs",
      "I took this lab online with Sue Stathopulos. I would say that this was my favourite lab I took so far. It's well organized and engaging. She makes sure that students are well prepared for the lab reports by having you read the background info and lab procedure and completing an ESP and pre-lab assignment that tests you on your knowledge of the lab techniques, theory, etc. Then you watch the recorded lab procedure and complete a data sheet. After that, you write your lab report. There are also 2 tests that cover the experiments you did. Pretty straight forward! I would highly recommend this lab to those who enjoy chemistry.",
      "Good luck if you have a bad TA. Can be easy depending on which TA you have but if you get an annoying TA goodluck. ",
      "Very organized, reliable, and well done. Very reasonable expectations and felt like i didnt miss out on any knowledge that i should have learned if the lab had been in-person like it was supposed to be. The lab write-ups were also nice and short but still covered all the concepts.",
      "Lab reports were really easy. I don't think there was enough information provided about the lab techniques for the lab quiz though.",
      "Sue can be nice but come off as condescending really quickly ",
      "Choose your TA wisely. Ask for help when you need it. Make sure you make friends in the lab so you have someone to go to in case your TA is like mine. ",
      "sue made the class good/engaging",
      "Interesting experiments, but the report marking depends largely on your TA. and that final exam was a bit absurd. ",
      "This course is quite difficult I found, the labs are intense and there is no room for error, whether it's in your performance, lab report, or experimental procedure summary. It is really stressful, and make sure to pick a good lab partner and use your resources as much as possible (TAs, Piazza, etc)",
      "Teaches basics of first year chem techniques. Lab reports somewhat hard and PLA pretty challenging but overall enjoyed it",
      "This course was well organized by Sue, with expectations and instructions being well laid out. There are 5 labs to complete (3 informal reports, 1 formal and 1 done in the lab). All are reasonable and you have two weeks to complete them. Writing out the lab instructions before the lab and be a tedious task but is easy (do a good job because they will take your lab manual away at some point). The pre-lab quizzes are a little difficult, make sure to review your lab manual since all the answers are in it. At the end of the course, there is an exam worth 40% of your final grade. It is kinda difficult and really does not make sense to have an exam in a lab course, but it's there. Pick a good lab partner and I hope you get a good TA, those components can really make or break your grade and experience.",
      "This course was very organized and easy to be successful in. The lab manual is pretty much all that you need to be prepared for the actual lab, the pre-lab assessments, and the final exam. The course instructor and TAs were very clear when giving instructions, helping out during the lab, and when responding to questions. I learned a lot of practical skills that I ended up using in some of my other labs this term. ",
      "Organized and structured much better than the bio lab. This is what a real lab feels like, I can tell. The TAs actually know what they're doing, and the instructor is PRESENT. There are many opportunities to increase your grade, with pre-lab assignments and post-lab reports. Although it is extremely time-consuming to do all this extra work for a lab, it is worth it in the end. I also learned many valuable skills in this course as a science student, such as how to write a lab report and work in the lab. It is a very professional environment but not to the point where it is dreadful. I was excited to go to this lab every other week. Don't be intimidated by the final exam, even though it is confusing as to why a lab has a written final exam, it's more of a grade booster esp if you didn't do as well as you would have liked in your post-lab reports. Some TAs mark harshly while others do not, so the instructor implemented an adjusted average marking scheme in which your final grade could increase or decrease depending on how unfairly your TA marked you. I recommend watching the pre-class experimental videos to have an idea of what to do before you enter the lab.",
      "better than biol 130l. had a nice ta that marks fairly. watch the pre-videos to understand what to do in the labs. prof was actually there to help out. no online labs so u can actually get two weeks to write ur lab reports, which dont take as much time compared to biol 130l. idk why there is a 40% final exam, but redo the pre-lab quizzes and especially the practice final test, will def help.",
      "This course is taught and organized way better than BIOL 130L. The lab instructor always had lab technique videos posted of her doing each experiment to completion, prior to the lab day. Watching these really helped when making experimental procedure summaries (EPS) and when doing the pre-lab assignments (PLA). The PLA's were slightly difficult in my opinion, because I thought that some of the content tested wasn't in the lab manual. However, this was really just my lack of review before doing the PLA's, the answers were pretty much all there and I realized that when studying for the final exam worth 40% of your final mark. I thought it was silly to have a final exam in a lab course, but it actually brought my mark up; finished this course with a 90% despite getting a harsh TA who was brutal when giving out lab performance marks and lab report marks. My TA was super nit-picky because he perceived my handwriting to be messy and deducted so many marks for each of the 5 lab reports and when I asked others if they found my writing to be messy, they said no. Your grades are dependent on your TA, but there is a curve which accounts for different marking schemes of different TA's which is nice. In my opinion, the final exam was not difficult at all, just know what you did for each experiment and why and also be able to do all the calculations you did in your reports. Overall, this was a nice and organized lab. Good luck!",
      "Exceptionally organized course, I appreciate Sue so much for that. Everything you need to know for the lab reports and pre-lab assignments (PLAs) is in the lab manual, on LEARN, or in the experiment videos shared by Sue. You are given one week to complete the PLAs and at the end of the term, you have the opportunity to replace your lowest PLA mark with another assignment. The labs themselves are also quite enjoyable. For the last lab though, be sure to read and understand the post-lab report in advance, as you will be expected to submit it by the end of the class. As for the final exam, it was truly not bad at all. I remember reading older reviews and panicking on the day of my exam, but it is honestly more than doable. As long as you've read the manual, taken notes on the experiments and techniques, and reviewed the concepts that Sue (kindly) shared on the review sheet, you will be fine :)",
      "I liked it, but it was also really stressful being in there for the first time as a 1A student. The lab wasn't difficult (as in, the techniques weren't too hard) but some of the lab reports I struggled with because it was my first time writing in that format. It's fairly easy to pull your grade back up because the lab reports aren't worth a huge amount and the exam is decent, the practice exam wasn't really helpful though. ",
      "Kinda difficult at times but overall just not very interesting ",
      "This lab isn't too bad, and I was able to get everything done and leave early for most of them. The lab reports themselves are alright, and you get a general idea of what you'll be doing from the prelab assignments. It's pretty easy to get a decent mark as long as you follow the instructions. "

The term tests and exams did not have any trick questions and they were do-able if you paid attention, did the practice problems, and listened to professor Ingram's tips/tricks she gives during lectures. The content of this course is an expansion of grade 12 chemistry. If you got an 85-95% in grade 12 chem, you can expect about an 80-93% in the course.

Some of the stuff about entropy and enthalpy can be a little confusing, so make sure you know what you're doing there. CHEM 123 is very similar to CHEM 120 structure wise (2 midterms, final, online assignments), and it's easy to get a good mark in both if you are willing to put in the effort and really nail those practice problems. I had this course with Rick Marta who I would totally recommend. Course notes weren't available to buy this time (unlike for CHEM 120 where we could buy a bound copy at the bookstore) so we had to print them. Make sure you do!

That said, the profs were great. Carey Bissonnette is a very organized coordinator and I like his dry sense of humour. Rick Marta is the GOAT and Laura Ingram is also great. Let these profs' lectures videos carry you through the course if you have any of them. Also, DO THE SAMPLE MIDTERMS/EXAM! Half the questions were the same with numbers changed, and the other half were very similar. Midterm 1 was pretty easy, average was 78. Midterm 2 was harder, average was initially mid-60s before they shaved off a mark and it became a 70. Overall not the most interesting subject matter, but run very effectively with very fair evaluations. ",

      "this was by far the worst course I've ever taken. ",
      "Very well structured, just like CHEM 120. However, I feel like this time around the professors did not put in as much effort as they did last term. For instance, practice exams and questions used to always have full solutions in the answer key. This term we were left with circled answers wondering where we went wrong. They also were not as active on piazza as they were last term; several questions were left unanswered.\n\nTA sessions I found were not helpful either. At times they were more confused than I was. I would recommend anyone in this course to refer to the textbook as much as possible, especially for practice problems.",
      "this course is significantly more difficult than CHEM120. in my opinion, the midterms are made to \"gotcha\" you and ask about stupid details that weren't explained in the lectures, with the level of difficulty it is nearly impossible to give 100% thought to each question and be able to finish all the questions in time. this all may be because I took it online during COVID, but even so, you should watch out for this course. if you can, get a tutor early.  ",
      "Pretty easy in my opinion. Just do lots of practice problems and make sure you don't enter the wrong numbers on your calculator, and you'll be fine.",
      "Actually pointless. They only attempt to teach how to solve specific questions and then ask different ones after failing to teach anything. Laura is an absolute gem but apart from her everything about the course is so bad. The midterm went so badly because they didn't show clocks, they left no time for actually doing the 6 calculations for each \"select all that apply\" question (timed for literally 2 minutes each), that we had a midterm re-do. Thank you Dr. Ingram, but the rest was all trash.",
      "Most useless course I have ever taken in my several years of academics. Everything \"taught\" is to show us how to perform specific questions on the assignments and tests; I haven't learnt a single useful application to any real life thing. The entire point of this course seems to be to make us learn how to do different kinds of questions. This course has broken my will multiple times; to say I despise it would be an understatement. I still do not understand why it is a requirement for Physics majors, when nothing useful comes out of this course apart from how to memorize how to do specific problems.",
      "Where do I begin. I feel like I didn't get much out of this class, I don't see where I could apply much content to other situations in my major unlike chem120. Not to mention that debacle of a midterm, if it weren't for my immaculate guessing skills I wouldn't have passed. Grateful for the redo though.",
      "Overall, a nice intro to different branches of more quantitative chemistry. I found this course to be quite easy as it is mostly plug and chug numbers. ",
      "This is a hard course. Not because it is conceptually difficult, but because you have to memorize a million equations and types of questions. There is no \"I get this so I dont need to practice\". There are dozens of types of questions you need to be able to do in EACH UNIT, and you need to memorize every single one. You need to be able to do every single question in the course notes perfectly in under 3 minutes, because that is what is required for the midterm and exam. Now I didn't do any of this because I am incurably lazy, and barely passed, so take what you will from that. ",
      "Maybe my opinion is biased as a physics student who had to take this course, but I disliked it. They cram a bunch of formulas you need to memorize, but at least we were allowed to write a help sheet for the exam. Something like 80% of the course has to do with equilibriums. If you take this course, be prepared to receive an aneurysm every single time you hear someone say \"equilibrium\" in public. \n\n",
      "Took this course to fulfill list 1 NSE requirement in ECE. Course content was pretty simple. Cheat sheet is provided with all formulas, questions were mostly use just plug and chug into formulas. Also, questions were often taken directly taken from examples covered in lectures. Only challenge is quantity of material, lots of lectures to cover each week.\n\nThere are weekly quizzes and participation challenges, but you can transfer their weight to two midterms and finals.",
      "This course is difficult if you don't do the assignments or practice questions. I'm begging you, PRACTICE, PRACTICE, PRACTICE",
      "Big learning curve at start of course (drill Unit 1 info into your brain), cumulative content. Time-consuming but fine. Tried for first midterm and got 96, didn't really for second midterm and got 69 lol jokes (did well on the exam though) - all multiple- or many-choice though, which has the singular benefit of easy grading and all the disadvantages of not fairly evaluating a student's learning/thought process, given that they did most work right and got the wrong answer. Otherwise would've given 123 an easier rating",
      "This was a required course for me, the pacing was weird and the lectures were boring and it was hard to focus. The participation challenges and assignments helped learn the material. I recommend doing the assignments with the recommended due date, that way even if you're not going to lectures, you will still understand everything. I did pretty well overall, the grading felt fair.",
      "Concepts hard to understand in the beginning, requires much practice to fully understand processes. Had difficulties understanding in-class examples, mostly due to the professor themselves.",
      "Very organized course. Professors are really helpful. If you pay attention and practice you will succeed. ",
      "so much worse than chem 120. got dunked on so hard on the midterms and finals despite studying so hard for them. just accept the low mark and move on. same mark breakdown and structure of teaching as chem 120 except they didnt curve any of the midterms nor shift all the weight of ur worst midterm to ur final. also imo profs kinda got lazy with actually explaining concepts and didnt answer a lot of questions on piazza.",
      "lots of content and definitely need to stay on top of preclass and assignments to fully understand the content. though they have formula sheets in tests, but you still kinda need to memorize most of them to have enough time on the tests, a lot more content and calculation compared to 120 but is still very much doable. laura slayyys",
      "The format of the course as more or less the same as CHEM 120. There were pre-class videos, in-class lectures, weekly assignments and participation challenges. It was definitely harder than CHEM 120 though, especially the acids and bases module. However, it's still easy to do well if you keep up with the assignments, particpation challenges and extra practices. Do not fall behind as content from the previous module is used in the next. The tutorials were a lot more useful this term as well. The TAs explain things more simply and teach concepts in a way that actually help you understand. ",
      "The course is very organized, and the assignments are very helpful in terms of practicing and preparing for tests and exams (highly recommend keeping up with the recommended schedule). Dr. Ingram is very clear during the lecture and goes over the examples one by one, with many clicker questions during class for students to participate in. With the number of resources provided in the course (assignments, participation challenges, clicker questions, module practice, pre-class videos, etc), finishing with very high grades is definitely possible. The course mainly focused on thermochemistry and equilibrium, which requires the use of equations for calculations (equations are provided on the datasheet). Overall, the course content and lectures were very interesting and engaging. ",
      "CHEM 123 on a general note is a very difficult and time consuming course. In my opinion this course is easy for chemistry majors and people who are genuinely interested in studying in chemistry. But if you are someone who struggles with chem or is an average student, this course is difficult. To ace this course its very important that you have a good prof. Dr. Marta was an amazing prof for this course and I passed because of him. His teaching is really clear and easy and he calms his students down before any class or exam since some of the students can fail. The course needs your time and commitment. So do not skip classes and do not miss lecture videos or assignments. Meet deadlines!! - that is the only way to stay on top of everything. With Dr Marta's teaching this course was easy to follow through. The course has two midterms, a final and bunch of assignments and participation challenges...do not skip any component since all of them will really help your average.  ",
      "as someone who heavily struggled with chem120, my hopes for this course weren't high. however, i managed to get high marks in all the exams, assignments, and pcs, without stressing too much. \nhere's my advice:\n- watch all the pre-class content, and take notes beforehand so that you can actually focus on the content during class and not spend the entire time copying everything down.\n- if you do miss a class, watch the recording to catch up that same day. try your best to not fall behind, it gets out of control very easily. \n- try to follow the recommended assignments deadlines, or at least attempt each assignment before it's associated pc is due.\n- don't try to cram. if you keep up with the course content and complete all the assignments and pcs on time, and study with the practice tests/final, you'll do great. ",
      "Although this course was a tad bit heavy, I ended with a 90+. Grade breakdown similar to CHEM 120, but focusing more on thermodynamics and equilibrium. The participation challenges and assignments (both each worth 10%) are easy marks, do them right after the lecture material. To succeed in the tests and the exam, do all the practice material (practice exams, assignments) and ensure you understand the concepts and the formulas, not just memorize them! It is easy to fall behind, but if you practice a lot and stay on top of material, you can do well!"

      "The experiments were a bit more interesting than the fall counterpart. I liked them more. Although, the course structure is identical to the CHEM 120L pretty much. Pre-lab quizzes and procedure summaries force you to read over and understand the key aspects of the experiment before entering the lab, so you should already have a good idea of what you are doing. TAs are quite helpful, and the professor is as well. ",
      "I liked the experiments we did in this lab. Make sure you read everything well before coming to class and complete all quizzes on time; it was a really fair lab.",
      "A good lab course. Experiments are interesting and the lab reports are fairly easy (you get two weeks to complete them). The final MC exam is also pretty easy.",

      "Similar to 120L. ",
      "Boring",
      "Standard lab, just like 120L. I'd recommend to start the labs early so that you can ask about certain things that aren't obvious. For example, the first lab has some terms from Orgo that need to be defined and I lost marks by doing it the night before. Overall, lab was not that bad.",
      "Similar to 120L but has some random labs that use material you haven't covered yet. I advise starting the labs early (not last minute) for this reason, so you can go get help with the Orgo",
      "Be careful with what your lab reports are asking you, and study those questions carefully for the final.",
      "The exam was....... a real killer",
      "It was more useful than CHEM 120L and actually had applications with the material worked on in class. The lab and course are not very well lined up though so it's really hard to do lab calculations  when you haven't learned how to do them in lecture. The reports were harder and so was the exam. ",
      "The labs are easier that 122L, your mark is really just dependent on your TA. Concepts are simple though, nothing to challenging required",
      "Fun labs",
      "The lab reports can be extremely time consuming! The final exam was quite challenging, but less challenging than the 120 lab exam. ",
      "So boring, waste of my time writing dumb lab reports. Easy 90+ with a good TA. My TA was way better than 120l TA. 120L TA you should be like my 123L TA/",
      "The labs this time around are much more difficult as compared to Chem 120L, however it is run exactly the same, and so with Chem 120L under your belt, good marks are attainable.",
      "Make sure you do all of the labs early, as they take much longer than you'd expect (especially the reactions rate lab)",
      "Had to take this as a physics major, but I feel like this will be totally useless later on",
      "Good lab but the final is hard. Lots of questions with not enough time. The lab reports are also very time consuming",
      "Very similar to CHEM 120L. The problem was that CHEM123 and CHEM123L were not in sync, and so we had to do equilibrium problems before we learned them in lecture. Sue does a good job of explaining how to do the problems in the lab manual, but it's a good idea to start them early so you can get help if needed. Lab report marking really depends on how picky your TA is. The experiments done were pretty fun! However the final was not fun because it was very calculation based and felt very long. It was hard because you had to know the methods for a lot of different types of calculations, and having both the CHEM 123 and CHEM 123L exams on the same day didn't help. It definitely brought a lot of marks down. ",
      "Disjointed w the lec. Terrible TA  who didn't talk to us and mislead us pretty often.-_-",
      "Labs were easy to do, write up were about the same as 120L. Find out how strict your TA is in the first lab, then decide all your writing on that (my TA would take 3 marks off for labels on graphs..).\n\nStudy all of the possible reactions for the exam, it'll really kill you.",
      "Very tedious lab reports, and your TA can make or break your mark on those. The exam was a slaughter. Required you to do  calculations on it which were longer than on the CHEM 123 exam. Much harder than the 120L exam. And it doesn't help that they make the 123 and 123L exams on the same day. :(",
      "Very similar to 120L. Pretty easy.",
      "This course, just like CHEM 120L, was nicely structured. Sue is such a sweetheart and she will provide so many opportunities to boost up your marks. However, her lab tests are BRUTAL (and often times unfair). We are expected to be able to answer 40 questions (most of which are calculation based), in around 80 minutes.\n\nYour performance, lab report wise, I think will depend on your TA. Attend your TAs office hours, as they will talk about their expectations for lab reports and such there. Do not hesitate to email your TAs or Sue; better to be safe then sorry, considering your lab report marks will carry you throughout the course.",
      "my opinion is that this course is just CHEM120L part 2. literally, sue set the course up the exact same way, so if you did well in CHEM120L you'll likely get a similar mark in this course. she makes the lab tests exceptionally difficult (and, as I've heard, in non-covid years the lab exams as well) so try and get as many marks as you can before that point. some labs may be difficult to understand, don't be afraid to ask sue or TAs for help though, they are mostly very nice and clear when explaining things to students. ",
      "I think this course prepares students for future chemistry lab courses well. The course is well organized and the professor provides ample examples to illustrate why and how certain things work the way they do. However, the I felt that the TA quality was lower in comparison to CHEM120L. ",
      "I took this course in Winter 2022 and I was really excited to be in a lab setting post-Covid. The experiments were fun and I was lucky to have a really good TA. He was very helpful and I had great marks on the lab reports and assignments. What annoyed me was final lab exam was worth 40% of my grade and the lab reports totalled 35%, so majority of my grade was going to be decided by the one exam, not the 5 reports I spent hours working hard on. It didn't help that I bombed the final even though every question seemed so simple. So after performing so well the whole semester the end killed my mark, which sucks but I'd say just preparing really well for the final is crucial.",
      "Interesting experiments, but the report marking depends largely on your TA. and that final exam was a bit absurd. ",
      "Sue & labs were great, lots of content but fun/useful. Exam is surprisingly hard though, do your practice questions/review",
      "The experiments in this lab are much more straight forward than the experiments in chem 120L in my opinion. The post lab reports were not more difficult than the ones we had to do in chem 120L and there is no full lab report. Instead, there is a lab (experiment 4) that has a bunch of report sheets that are 99% calculations. That lab essentially murdered everyone taking the lab, especially those who had it in the first week. The content in the lab is taught in chem 123 lectures AFTER all the lab reports have been submitted, which made it difficult for everyone to complete the lab in the first place. Utilize the pre class videos for chem 123 lectures (module 4) to help you with this lab as after we learned the content in lecture, everything made so much more sense. The exam is not too terrible, its just tricky in some questions. ",
      "thought this would be a continuation of chem 120l, but it was much harder. the labs itself werent that hard but the post lab reports (especially the titration and calorimetry lab) were very hard to calculate. the titration lab was done before the titration unit started in the chem 123 lecture, so u couldnt use anything u learned in class and apply it to the lab (which is the whole concept of the lab). i was lucky enough to get a very nice ta that marked easily and gave me tips on how to calculate them. the final exam prep had so many mistakes and wasnt even representative of the final exam, so doing that was a huge waste of time. wish the final exam prep was representative bc that final made my mark drop 13%. mark breakdown is the same as chem 120l.",
      "fun and interesting labs, many of the reviews said the exam is horrible, i think they are at the same level as the lecture exam, it's a fair exam with material from the manual, but because it's more calculation focused making it more time consuming. ",
      "disappointed in myself because I worked so hard throughout the entire semester on my lab reports etc only to get a 57 on the exam and drop my entire mark by 12%. make sure to study hard for the exam and don't underestimate the fact that even though its a written lab exam, it WAS NOT EASY AT ALL. they didn't give us proper preparation for it whatsoever. the practice exam they gave us literally had 4 incorrect questions. The labs itself were fun to perform but the post-lab reports were GRUELING and took up so much of my time. it was basically another course with a full term of work to do. i understand that its a chemistry lab but holy, I hated the post lab reports so much that I dreaded having to study and redo them all over again for the exam which is probably why I didn't do as well as i wanted. moral of the story: if you want to do good, treat every lab report like its a life or death exam :D"

If you have a poor TA and you feel like your stuff deserves a higher mark, the prof will give you an even lower mark for bothering him. The average on the exam for 2017 was a 48 or something. For an excel course it takes itself way to seriously. Don't take unless it's a prereq. ",
      "Fairly boring. The prof explained things clearly but it just wasn't interesting and the explanations often seemed a bit long winded.

",
      "Course was relatively easy, and very useful for future applications (teaches you all about how to use Excell scientifically). Unfortunately, can't say the same for the teaching. Fans were blazing loudly and microphones weren't used until the last few labs, so it was very difficult for those at the back to hear anything. On top of that, half of the TA's don't even know what they're doing and some don't even provide help \n\nThe grading as well was awful, way more emphasis was put towards 'disucssion questions' at the end of the lab than the actual lab itself. Normally that would be fine, but they're so brutal when it comes to marking them. They say not to put too much info, but if you put too little they end up roasting you for not including enough information but then if you think you've put a fair amount of detail, they still roast you for putting \"too much\"",

Excel knowledge given can be learned elsewhere or through experience. \n\nPrevious excel knowledge does more harm than good, as the amount of specificities that are marked for make it very hard to do well as there is always another thing that you lose marks for. \n\nWeekly assignments have a pre-lab, that you must score 95% on to access the assignment. This assignemnt is through mobius, and answers have to be very specific to register as correct. One wrong number / incorrect sig fig will cause you to go under 95%, making you redo the pre-lab. Oh, also the numbers change every time, so you waste time re-inputting numbers into your spreadsheet, then into mobius. Overall quite a large time-sink.\n\nLook somewhere else for a bird course, this course isn't it.",

There is VERY little help given and the teaching format is having a 45-page word document riddled with spelling and grammatical errors assigend at the beginning of the week and having to decipher it and hope you understood enough to be given an okay mark on the assignments. Marking scheme is egregious and is far too expectant for an \"introductory\" excel course. Asked the TA for help, and as much as I appreciate his honest response, he told me he wasn't quite sure what Jake (professor) was even asking in the question. It is clear that little to no effort has been put into designing and or updating this course. This course is very decieving to say the least as it is made out to be a beginner course but I can promise you'll be stuck on the pre-lab for several hours at a time as a 95% or higher is required to progress. I think you can imagine how discouraging this course can get",
      "One of the easiest courses I\u2019ve taken in my first year. Don\u2019t let the reviews mislead you true Dr Fisher may not mark the skill set and final the ideal way and the avg for those are always in the 40\u2019s but together they don\u2019t even make up your full grade for the course. Watch his videos and do the pla\u2019s early so you won\u2019t stress yourself last moment. Don\u2019t expect a very high grade for the course though but above it is super easy to get above a 65 for the course even if you fail both the final and skill set. Very useful course for 2nd year labs such as 250L, 220L. Also Jake Fisher is super nice and very helpful once you get to upper year courses unlike in 140. Once you get to 1B it\u2019s all about planning and not doing work last moment ",
      "This course is, to put it simply, a disaster. It's an online course that's structured as if it's in-person. The grading is complete nonsense, while you might feel you're doing well on the weekly assignments (70s-80s), when the midterm and final come around, don't expect to get higher than a 40. The variation between Jake Fisher's grading and the rest of his TA's in ridiculous. The TA feedback is pretty much useless, so it's hard to 'do better', as we don't necessarily know what's wrong. This course may provide helpful skills for upper-year courses but it's hell to complete. ",
      "This was the most interesting course I have ever taken in first year. It is very different from traditional lecture/lab courses, but will leave you prepared with a good set of technical skills. The pre-labs are lengthy but Dr. Fisher provides sufficient video resources + the manual is very detail-heavy. However, it is easy to become complacent; there is a large discrepancy between how your TA might mark and how Dr. Fisher marks, hence the notoriously low midterm grades. However, the 95% requirement for pre-labs + doing decent on the assignments will offset any low midterm marks you get, so do not worry too much. Definitely DO spend time learning Excel because it'll become immediately useful for many of your other courses. Good luck.",
      "CHEM 140 is definitely a useful course, but its difficulty is hidden until you come across the midterm (skills test) and final assignment. You can go the entire course getting 80s and 90s on the in-class exercises and then get a 30 on the skills test (for which the average is likely a 40). Final is not much better, the instructions can be extremely unclear on anything you do and the PLAs are sometimes a nightmare. You are required to get a 95% on these, while usually it's quite easy, the assignment is quite picky on sig figs. Make sure you read the given materials (course notes), they are posted with each in-class exercise. Everything else provided that isn't mandatory to do is pretty useless IMO, the videos just cover the course notes in a recording. Overall, decent course, very useful for anything involving data analysis and Excel, but exams can be hard. Personally I wish this was CR/NCR like CS136L.",
      "I found the exercises decently engaging and the skills taught useful - one warning about the class is that you will get high grades with the exercises, but do terribly on the midterm, as in 30% average. They will not curve this."

The hardest part of the whole course is that your only resources is what he provides on Learn, since it's very hard to find anything to read that's at our level! Hopkins provides an amazing number of resources, however, so it's definitely manageable.",

      "The course notes made by Dr. Hopkins are probably the thing you'll want to refer for anything. I had Pavle as my prof, good man, funny, intelligent. Just not made for teaching, at least for this course. You can tell he's passionate in what he's teaching but relaying his knowledge to his students isn't great. He will often ask a question, we answer it, the answer we give is usually correct but then he has to re-word the same question in a way that the answer he wants it specific to a point. This happens(ed) a lot. I ended up dropping the course. Done 2 biweekly assignments, and 5 weekly quizzes, none of which I have gotten my grade back going into reading week. I do not know how I am doing in the course, grade wise, but I know for a fact that I'm struggling strictly based on my experience in class with the content. The way this class is/was graded it's 25% midterm and 50% exam, the rest is quizzes and assignments. Seeing that I don't know where I stand, this is why I dropped the course. I am only in my 2A term as a chem major but the prereqs say CHEM 123(5), I think that is false. Everything covered has related to nothing in those prereqs. My class consists(ed) of roughly 10 or so second years, mostly everyone else is 4th and some third. For them, this is more/less review and I personally think that this course is not 200 level. CHEM 264 is easier than this in my opinion.",

Dr. Pavle one of the best profs and he takes the time to explain over and over until someone understands the idea, he always spend time after class answering questions and willing to help outside his office hours. He is very engaging in teaching the materials "

      "Easy to get a good mark - final is really easy, but the information is complicated.",
      "This course is probably pretty easy if you're interested in inorganic chemistry and point groups etc., but I found it incredibly dull. I'd rather be learning organic and doing synthesis rather than learning the shapes and structures of solids etc, but whatever floats your boat. It is pretty essential knowledge for future courses, so it's good to learn the basics here...just slog through it the best you can.",
      "Avoid like the plague if you can. Not a good course to take. ",
      "Very good if you have a quantum course/background. Also any knowledge of group theory/ spherical harmonics will help. Super interesting for material science, understanding MO theory. I do not recommend if you have Sonny Lee, knows his stuff however keeps his class avg low for a reason. ",
      "Content seems extremely important for those who plan on pursuing inorganic chemistry. Definitely required effort to get a good mark.",
      "This is a hard course, no doubt but if you really try hard, as in go into his office and ask questions weekly, practice all of his inclass examples (even if you wrote them down wrong, just ask again after class) you will be able to achieve a decent mark.",
      "I found this class super interesting and Dr. Deakin is very clear and gives awesome lecture notes to work off of. Not a bird course in the least, but if you study smart and pay attention in class I don't think it's too difficult. Though this is a mandatory biochem class, the content won't be super useful for me going forward. Definitely very interesting though. ",
      "If you take this course with Sonny, you're in for a wild ride. Half the class drops the course after the first midterm and averages for midterms are always in the 30s. Course concepts are fairly abstract and fairly hard to practice. Tutorials will save your life. The midterms are 50 minutes and you will fail if you don't have a great understanding of the material. Achieving over a 60 in this course and/or passing it on your first try is an accomplishment Lol. Extremely useful if you want to pursue inorganic chemistry further. Also group theory sucks.",
      "Yes this course is one of the toughest you\u2019ll ever face in your undergraduate degree partly it\u2019s because of the subject matter being so complex and Dr Lee tests very difficult and be aware of negative marks for incorrect statements made. Nevertheless I liked most of the content especially MO theory, and Dr Lee was very considerate in having review sessions most of them were organized by the CHEM club and he sponsored the last one, willing to aid if you show interest. Fascinating person indeed!",
      "This course is WILD. I was one of the few who quite enjoyed it. The content is very out there, especially once you get to Group theory and symmetry onwards. The best thing you can do is a lot of practice material. Hopefully tutorial quizzes still exist, they were gifts from the gods in terms of real questions like the midterm. Good luck soldiers.",
      "I nearly failed both midterms but got my act together for the exam (worth a high %) and managed a decent grade overall first try! Here are my tips for success: (1) Do not treat lectures as optional. You will have a very hard time (and waste time) finding the information given in a lecture that you didn\u2019t attend. This course is largely about using theory to make valid arguments and predictions. These explanations and arguments are only given out loud and on the whiteboard (which is not posted afterwards). The slides do not have explanations and are mostly just visual aid during lecture. You also cannot find those same arguments anywhere on the internet, and not even in the textbook in most cases. This also means you can no longer google anything you missed in lecture because the most correct, course-specific answers will not be there. So attend lecture and take good notes. (2) Focus on the problem sets and tutorials for most of your studying. The problem sets are very helpful in preparing for the midterms and exams. Most of what you will ever need is in the course work. (3) Attend office hours! It goes without saying that you need to participate fully in this course to do well. So treat office hours as more lecture time. I recommend 1-2 times a week. Make the effort to prepare questions and ask them in office hours. By preparing questions, you\u2019re training your brain to understand the content in more depth and clarity. If you can\u2019t come up with even one question after lecture, it\u2019s a strong sign that you are not understanding the content at all. In that case, attend office hours and listen to other student\u2019s questions. Or, do the assignments during office hours, and if a question arises ask right away. This is a much more efficient use of your time compared to struggling in silence. (4) Be patient. You are not going to understand 90% or even 50% of the material the first time in lecture, and you are not expected to. It would be ideal to read the textbook before lecture, but that\u2019s not always possible. Either way, you need to struggle with the material until it starts to make sense, but do not struggle alone, attend lectures, tutorial, office hours, ask questions, and be motivated to learn. Good luck and hope this helps! "

      "Straightforward class. Do practice questions, and you should get a good mark.",
      "This course literally makes you brain-dead. It's all regurgitated from previous chemistry courses (buffers, titrations, etc.). This makes it super easy, but its SO BORING!!!! The textbook is blessed for writing any lab reports in the future, so get a nice PDF of that.",
      "I was nervous going into this course after seeing negative reviews, but it was an incredible experience! Stacey made the material easy to digest and fun to learn! I did a lot better than I thought I would and it became one of my favourite courses. The content seems to have been revamped from previous semesters and you can tell! ",
      "Honestly, this course has COMPLETELY changed from previous years. Stacey is the instructor for Chem 220L and definitely knows her stuff, her midterms are straightforward and easy, she's always there to help and fit you accomodations. The course content is pretty simple and she presents it in really easy to digest yet engaging ways. Without her presentation of the course content it would be pretty boring, but she lays out everything very simply. All you have to do is try your best, be honest with Stacey about your progress and do your best on the two assignments and midterms, its a breeze after that! Good luck, and don't be discouraged by the ratings here, it's really not that bad, I think the professor really affects how the course is presented and Stacey does a great job.",
      "Like the other reviewers said, the course has completely changed after Stacey began teaching it. Her lecturing style is pretty engaging and she genuinely seems like she wants you to learn. Her assignments and midterms are straightforward and if you just study the lecture notes and slides you'll be completely fine. This is fortunate, because unlike the assignments and midterms, the final was absolutely tragic and bombed my grade, so make sure to get in as many points as possible before then. ",
      "Easy course as long as you study. I only watched the lecture recordings and still did fine. There is some memorization required for the spectroscopy/chromatography section, but nothing too awful, flashcards saved me.",
      "Analytical is so boring. Feels like a vocab class more than anything. Its pretty easy as long as you keep up and don't slack (which is harder than it sounds due to the boring nature)",
      "The course content is really really dry but Stacey does her best to make it as fun as possible and she really cares about her students' success. The course is very fair, with 3 midterms (each worth 15%), a final (34%), and 7 problem sets (usually due every other weekend, worth 21% total). Don't skip the problem sets because those are basically free marks and really come to save you if you struggle with tests.",
      "Loved Stacey one of my favourite profs at UW. I took this in my 2A along with math 106, PHYS 275, Chem 356,220L,250L and 200. Since I utilized all my time getting a firm grasp on QM and Astronomy and preparing for lab reports I always ended up putting CHEM 220 as a last moment study. Don\u2019t do that even though the content may seem easy little things like sig figs can trip you up and cost you marks which add up. Also the latter part of the course is where we were introduced to common spectroscopic techniques which though vital very boring. But Stacey does a fabulous job delivering the content to you and her testing is very fair. For an ideal 2A CHEM major the only major tests you would have are 220 and 264 so you would have enough time to grasp a firm grip of the subject matter and you better as critical and logical thinking are skills that you should posses once you start doing CHEM 212 and 265 in 2B",

      "Tips:\n1.  Do your experiments at a good pace but do it right and make sure you know what you're doing every experiment. A lot of my friends got shitty results/marks because they rushed their experiments. \n2. Titration is key learn how to do it properly.\n3. Watch experimental procedure videos before the lab to provide a visual guide for the steps. \n4. I like to write out a list of things to complete every lab this keeps me on track. \n5. TAs are AWESOME\n6. She'll usually open the lab ~10 mins early so if you get there early you can start setting up for the lab. (MAKE sure to wash your equipment every lab for best result) \n7. Adding onto 6 read the pages in the lab manual detailing how to wash equipment. \n8. Keep an eye on your equipment and don't break/lose them (you don't wanna end up paying for them they are expensive) \n\nFinal words/Personal Experience: \nHeidi scares me but if you follow the above tips you should do fine. Your TAs will be your best friends in this lab get on their good side. Most TAs are really nice so that shouldn't be a problem. \n\nPersonally I did pretty well in this lab thanks to those tips. Heidi likes to scare you for the first few weeks to make people drop because there's a LONG waiting list for this lab. Shrug her attitude away and focus on your experiment. :) Good luck in the lab! \n",
      "You really have to prep for the experiments before you go in in order to do well. Ask you TA's for help whenever and make sure you go over the calculations before submitting since 10% gets deducted for the second submission. ",
      "Do research and prepare beforehand, otherwise you'll fall behind. If you prepare well, however, it's definitely possible to finish your experiments a week early. The acceptable margin of error is small, though, so you have to be careful (the emphasis is on getting the right value, not just on doing the procedure right as in first-year chemistry labs).",
      "This course was amazing. For the first time, there's no worrying about your lab partner: it's just  you and the chemicals. When I took this course, it was just 4 long experiments and you organize your time accordingly throughout the semester: for students taking it in Fall 2016, you now have 7+ experiments, so I'm not sure how much the formatting's changed. It's a lot of work, but it's incredibly rewarding. I loved it.",
      "This course is great for teaching you basic lab skills. Great for learning how to write lab books, time management, etc. For actual experimental skills, recent developments in the course makes that difficult since the prof organizes everything for you. Also, they mark really hard! ",
      "Stacey is honestly the best prof ever. I loved working with all the new instruments and trying new stuff. The marking is pretty strict if you're not great at lab work, but she does go over some of the basics. Definitely recommend. ",
      "Stacey is a gem. This lab is fun and super useful, but do read the procedures ahead of time and plan what you're going to do or else you will run out of time. This lab is way more fast paced than the first year chem labs, which can make them more stressful. If ever you're having any issues just talk to Stacey, she's so approachable and friendly. ",
      "I later TA-ed this lab in my 3B term. Fairly easy, but most of your grade comes from your accuracy.",
      "This class is all about perfecting your lab skills and techniques.  The marks are mostly based on the accuracy of your results which makes it tricky to get a good mark.  But the professor is amazing and she wants you to do well.  She cares about your well-being and success in the class and is always prepared to share tips and tricks and help you get back on track if you need it. ",
      "While useful, this course was not easy. You WILL need the full 3 hours to get accurate results so do not try to rush through the labs. You are graded on your accuracy. As long as you follow the timeline in the procedure you should do fine though",
      "VERY challenging but useful lab! You have 3 hours but it feels like half an hour considering the amount of work we have to do for each experiment. A majority of the mark is for your accuracy and you need to find the right balance of being careful when measuring masses/ making standards, but not being overly cautious to the point where you're wasting time. You need to feel confident and prepared during the lab. Feeling unsure of any step will make you waste time and not finish, so prepare for the labs at least a week in advance to MEMORIZE the masses and volumes you need. It's way faster than constantly re-reading your procedure during the lab.",
      "unknown submissions are a killer in this course",
      "Really enjoyed this lab along with 250L if you read the procedure before hand you would be perfectly fine for the lab except for gravimetric which did take up time for some of us the rest of the labs could be done along with clean up in 2 hours and 30 minutes. Loved Stacey as my lab instructor and the TA\u2019s were always willing to help. Also maintain a clear and neat lab book and update it weekly and retain what you learn in boot camp \ud83d\ude09"

Stacey is always there to help and has really helpful office hours. She is so easy to approach and really does care for each student. The lab teaches you so many useful techniques. Also the calculations are very straight forward - with the exception of, I think one lab, which Stacey or the TA's clear up. Just follow the prelab, and if something is confusing just ask the TA's. Very easy to get a high 80.  ",

      "This course was really fun and the lab had a friendly, engaging atmosphere. I recommend taking it with Stacey, especially if you enjoyed the introductory analytical chemistry lab. The format is the same as how the CHEM 220L lab was run, but just with more advanced techniques (however if you did well in the previous course, you should be fine here!). I recommend finishing pre-labs and ~50% of lab reports over the weekend and finishing the rest during the week. And make sure to update your lab book each week! You DEFINITELY don't want to do it all at the end of the term since there are more instrument labs with chromatograms, etc.",
      "Incredibly useful course, teaching real life skills for chemists. Fun vibe, smaller classes than 220L and 6 hours meant there was no hustle. Despite being a 6 hour lab period, only one experiment took close 5 hours for me. Usually only takes 3-4 hours per class, reports are very easy."

The midterms and exams were fair and straightforward, but the multiple choice is a bit tough and tests some small details you may overlook when studying.

The lab instructor was also very kind and would walk around the lab to see if anyone needed help, and would provide extensions during busy weeks! The experiments were directly related to the lecture and roughly followed the order of the content we learned. Doing the pre-labs actually helped me understand the lecture content more easily which was nice. There was a pre-lab, experiment, and post-lab report every week, with the exception of one week as a break. The post-labs were packed with calculation questions but can be completed in roughly 5-7 hours. The calculations are straightforward but you do need to show all your work which can be a bit tedious. However, the reports are marked fairly and it's easy to get high 80 and 90s if you put in the effort. Some of the questions on the report are general in nature, so you can finish them earlier on to make your week a little easier :)"

The material that's tested is very random, some questions can be as simple as \"how many bonds can carbon make\" but other questions are much more complicated than anything taught in class or in lecture notes.

The exams are multiple-choice and T/F, but the multiple-choice questions are worth 2 marks each. Dara isn't the best lecturer, but she is definitely knowledgable and much more understanding than what most people give her credit for. She records all of her lectures and sort of has a sharp voice, which may or may not help you still awake during class (or when watching her videos).

The condition for passing the course was that your average of the midterms and final exam must be greater than 45%.

The quizzes were due every week and consisted of pretty simple recall and application questions straight from the lectures. There were also some case studies that were talked about during tutorials that had questions integrated into the quizzes.

There\u2019s not a whole lot of \u201cpractice\u201d you can do in this course other than some simple thermodynamics calculations but it\u2019s important to stay updated on the content since there are a lot of specific details that you are expected to remember and can be tested.

      "It is a lot of memorization, but I actually think the content is fun once you memorize what you need to. Professor is unparalleled in her ineptitude and horribleness though.",
      "I really enjoyed CHEM 237, but the prof definitely makes or breaks the course. For example, I originally signed up for this course in winter 2023 with prof Tanner, but I found the content to be really hard to understand (plus the fact that the prof was clearly not interested in teaching the class), so I dropped it early in the term because I genuinely thought I was going to fail. I retook 237 in the spring with Harmeen, and it was a completely different experience. Harmeen did such a wonderful job of teaching, and her passion for biochemistry was apparent in every lecture. The content in this class is very interesting and it's applicable for research and professional programs relating to STEM. My biggest pieces of advice for this course are to make flashcards for each unit, and to complete practice problems for the concepts that are more math/chem intensive. Overall, I would suggest taking this course with Harmeen (if possible). However, if you get stuck with a prof that is clearly disinterested/isn't very good at teaching, I would recommend reviewing concepts from CHEM 123 (especially the background of thermodynamics and buffers) and staying on top of the lecture material so you don't fall behind.",
      "I really enjoyed Biochem, but I think that it depends on the prof. Harmeen pushes active learning so the lectures were very engaging and fun. The course was very content heavy but if you attend office hours and ask questions you will do great! ",
      "This is the best chemistry course a biologist can take. Harmeen was very accommodating and her expectations of your knowledge of the course content were very clear. Super interesting course."

      "mark dropped a lot after exam\n",
      "Probably my favourite chem labs EVER.  It was really consistent with the lectures and they complemented each other really well -- the lab often helped me understand course content that I had difficulty with.  ",
      "I took this lab with Laura Marrone and it was an awesome lab. The experiments all use very similar lab techniques which is great for getting you familiar with certain equipment. The reports were not hard at all and the lab was pretty related to the material being taught in the course which was nice. There were no formal lab reports which was nice. Final was only worth 40% of the overall grade but was only out of 42, it wasn't hard but was easy to do poorly on if you got a few questions wrong. Definitely an 85% + lab. ",
      "Mark breakdown was supposed to be 7% prelab quizzes spread over 5 experiments (done at the beginning of each experiment, consists of 5 multiple choice questions about that day's lab), 8% performance, 45% lab reports spread across 6 experiments, and 40% final exam. The reports weren't too hard and are useful in helping you understand concepts from the lecture component. Can't comment on the difficulty of the lab exam because it was cancelled this term. Had Dr. Marrone as my lab instructor, she was awesome!",
      "Not a bad lab to take, it wasn't that easy but definitely doable. Took this lab all online because of COVID",
      "Took this Spring 2021 with Dr. Marrone. The marking scheme was 80% Lab Reports (6 in total) and 20% Lab Quizzes (6 in total). The first few lab quizzes were hard, but the last few were very easy. The lab reports were very fair. The lab content aligned very well with the CHEM 237 lecture content. I would strongly recommend taking both at the same time. The lab reports are easy to work on. Unlike CHEM 267L, the lab reports are done independently as there are many different data sets. Finished with a low 90, but a 85%+ is definetly possible.",
      "I like this lab a lot - the techniques you learn are very practical if you were to go to do biochemical experiments in the future. 6 lab reports + 6 lab quizzes + lab performance + lab final. The reports are all not formal lab reports but some of them are very very long, so be prepared to spend hours on a few of them. Start writing early and do not try to cram them - they are where the most marks are from. The lab final is only 35% but consists of a lot of information and you are not given any formula or amino acid structures - so make sure you spend some time studying for it. Overall it is fun and would recommend.",
      "Took this lab at the same time I took the lecture course. All the calculations and running the experiments discussed in the lecture course helped me do well in both courses. Be sure to prep for the labs and ask your TAs if you have any questions, they will help you out!",
      "Fun, easy course. Be super careful when doing experiments though because you'll actually lose marks if you mess up. TAs were good and both instructors were pretty nice. Arguably though there was no need for a final."

I had to more often than not teach myself the course through websites and the text book. That being said despite being taught by Chong I liked the course a lot. ",
      "This course taught a bunch of important concepts that will most likely be needed in future courses. Unfortunately, the fact that Chong teaches this means that:\n1. RIP your GPA.\n2. Things tend to be confusing because his notes are just all over the place. \nI probably would have enjoyed this course a lot more if another professor were teaching it.",
      "Honestly, if I'd dedicated a reasonable amount of time to the course each week, it would've been a lot easier. That said, I still finished with a great mark (relative for the course, anyway!) from doing what I could throughout the semester and studying hard for 4 days before the exam. The examples and practice questions look horrendous at first glance, especially since Chong by necessity moves very quickly through the course content - really though, it's all about memorizing the key concepts and then learning to recognize them in a reaction. For  instance,  the solvent DMSO favours SN2 reactions; if the solution's heated, it's a good clue that it's an elimination reaction. Keep a list of the key concepts, facts, and reactions, and you'll be fine.\n\nAlso, bite the bullet and buy a modelling kit. I split the smaller one with a friend of mine and it was more than enough, so the cost is absolutely worth it.",
      "Not an easy course by any stretch of the imagination, but its also not impossible to do well. Read over the chapters in the text book before lecture or as much of it as you can and then re-read it after lecture, this will maximize your understanding. Also do as many practice questions as you can, the text comes with worked solutions which are pretty helpful.",
      "OK the material is easy... (other than stereochemistry because some students have better perception than others). Focus more on doing the questions than memorising the concepts. Just be alert when it comes down to testing because they'll throw some devious questions, especially if you have chong. Oh... and DO NOT MEMORISE THE REACTIONS ENTIRELY!!!! Try to see why the reactions occur the way it is, and after you will see that the majority of the reactions occur in a similar way and follows a similar logic",
      "Notes are your Bible, make sure you print off the slides and write on that instead of writing down the notes from his slides in lecture. Having a note-tablet will really help in this class as Chong teaches really fast because of the density of the course. The model kit really helps in chair structures and will help you ace those midterms (MUST BUY). Key to understanding the reactions is basically figuring out where the charges are as that will guide you where it can connect (+ connects to -) kinda like building lego pieces. test questions are really tricky as they're pretty much combinations of the theory mashed up into one. Pro-tip: Acid-base reaction always happens first (well for this course). ",

You need to understand the mechanisms of everything! Memorization is for orgo 2",

Past exams are posted with no solutions so you're kinda just in the dark about everything.. If you take it in 2A, it will be the hardest course you've taken yet and add a lot of stress to your plate. Prof says not to memorize but that's all I did.. ",

      "This course can be a very tough course. You can easily mess up if you don't fully understand the material.  Average of 40 or 50 in midterms or even the final isn't kidding. However, if you use all the learning materials wisely, you can ace the course. I get a 90s in the course overall and find out it isn't bad as a lot of people say. Always use the weekly practice quizzes as very effective learning materials. All the quiz questions are harder, more difficult than midterm or the final exam (Chong deliberately does that to help us prepare for midterms) If you rock the quizzes, then midterms or the final would be a piece of cake for you. Don't try to memorize all the contents in orgo, instead fully comprehending mechanisms for each organic reaction and what each substituent does for acidity or basidity. Always practice on Tophat as the midterm might have questions similar to those Tophat problems. Most importantly, don't be terrified by this course, you can nail it!",
      "Lot of people before coming to 2A thing organic is going to be the death of them but in reality it\u2019s not. Sure you may not end up with a 90 unless you truly understand the concepts (ins and outs of it) but that\u2019s to be expected as this ain\u2019t high school any more. It\u2019s a fun and thrilling adventure don\u2019t let the course rating scare you. Have fun learning organic as you start your journey into the realm of CHEM.",
      "Foundational course for all chem-related programs. It is not as difficult as people hype it up to be. Do every practice question for each module. Acid-base, resonance, and stereochem is foundational for the rest of the course. If you struggle with that, get help ASAP or else it's over. \n\nKnow when your SN1/SN2/E2/E1 reactions occur and WHY they occur. In the later modules avoid memorizing the reaction products/results only (despite there being a lot); learn and draw out the mechanisms. It helps a lot (the only part where I memorized are the redox reactions, whose mechanisms are much more complex and so it's better to memorize the products). \n\nDo not skimp out on theory, ESPECIALLY the stability of reaction intermediates. It will help you with more complex reaction questions. And above all, practice, practice, and more practice. Go to office hours immediately if something does not make sense. \n\nThis course is perhaps the first time (for incoming first years) where everything TRULY builds upon itself. Master the first few modules--you should be able to recognize acid-base trends, R/S, and E/Z configuration in seconds. And again, PRACTICE! This course rewards practice above all else. "

The prof congratulates the class on the 60% midterm average, meaning that she thinks the course is too easy for everyone's liking and perhaps the midterms must be made even harder to ensure a 50% average. The best way to prepare for this course is to not be taking any other courses except this one, as the profs go so fast and cover so much content in one lecture ,that no one knows what is ever going on, and most people are often 3 chapters behind at all times. Perhaps if you dedicated 100% of your time to this course, you can get a decent mark.

      "Don't understand the outstanding negative association with this course, you just have to practice all of the reactions given.  The tophat chapters and practice questions are a BLESSING.  ",
      "Top hat saves your life. Do those questions over and over and go to lecture and you'll do fine. If you do bad on the midterms don't drop the course, prof will do a 100% final most likely- Gives you some time to salvage your grade. ",
      "definitely need to keep on top of material and do lots of study questions, but not impossible to get a good mark",
      "I've always been bad at chemistry so the difficulty of this course for me was not a surprise. The course went much too quickly for me to keep up and I'd come out of lecture more confused than I was before. They started to used the \"flipped classroom\" approach in lecture where you do the background reading before class, then come into class and do a quick review of the lesson then jump straight into examples. This method worked for some students, but I was not one of them. My one piece of advice is to read the course notes and keep up. It's so easy to fall behind and extremely difficult to catch up. \n",
      "Alright, so people view organic chemistry as the boogeyman of science courses. A lot of the negativity is overhyped. It's a really heavy course with a pretty low average, but the midterms and exams are very, very fair. Don't feel overwhelmed and give up - trust that knowing and understanding the material will translate to doing well and it will. Make sure you do all the practice midterms and exams they provide without cheating. You'll know where you stand based on these.",
      "I think the problem a lot of people have with organic chemistry is simply a lack of studying and practice. First of all, it is possible to do well. However, to do well you really need to understand what you're being taught. You can go to class, absorb the knowledge they give you, but you really need to practice, practice, practice. It is easy to say you understand something, but all too many times do people think they know something, when in reality they don't. Hence the reason for the 60% average on midterms. \n\nMy biggest pieces of advice for this course are as follows: (1). Buy the textbook (TopHat). It provides an online code for interactive quiz like questions. Practice, practice, and practice some more with those questions. (2). Buy the more expensive model kit. It's something like 40$, but wow does it come to save the day. Also, understand how to use the model kit. Don't just willy-nilly come into the midterm thinking you'll be able to know how to use it. Spend some time with it, practice some questions making models with the sticks and balls. (3). Go to office hours. I had Forsey, he was a charm and made understand some concepts pretty easy by going to him. Also, emailing him (or I am sure the other coordinator) is also very useful. He is pretty fast in responses. \n\nI was never really good at chemistry in high school or even the 100 level chemistry courses most people take, but I am expecting at least a 90 after the final. However, like Forsey says in class, \"It's memorization with understanding\". Memorize a few rules (well there is definitely a lot but it is manageable), and with a decent amount of practice you can get it down and do well. \n\nIs organic chemistry easy? No. I'm not going to sugar coat it. However, know you can do well, it is possible and it is manageable. No one is going to hand you free marks. Study, hustle, and you can definitely expect results (this feels like a motivational speech or something lol). Best of luck, you can do it!\n\n\n",
      "people will scare you into thinking this is a crazy difficult/ unmanageable course. its not. stay up to date with material, DO PRACTICE, don't fall behind (not at the start, not in the middle and not at the end) and you'll be fine. do old term tests and exams, really great practice and sometimes they'll reuse a question here and there. please stay on top of things in this course!!!",
      "Honestly I enjoyed this course. I am not gonna lie and say it was never hard, it was definitely hard to keep up in the beginning since it was all this new material being thrown at you and the course progresses really fast so you really gotta stay on top of your stuff. But, the midterms are really straight forward literally 0 tricks. Also, they divide the course at the end depending on what gives you the highest grade.",
      "This course gets a really bad rep and I can see why. It is a lot of work but you just need to do practice questions. I recommend doing the questions from the practice tests and redo the questions from the course notes. Also hint get TopHat and DO THE EXTRA QUESTIONS. They often put questions from the extra questions onto the Midterms and Finals, a trend I noticed, so if you do you can knock a few questions out.",
      "Loved the class, tophat is a lifesaver, go to office hours early on if you dont understand something, but honestly did not put that much effort in and got a 90. ",
      "Difficult course to take online. TopHat is great but you already knew that. Kritik doesn't feel like its designed for STEM courses. I wish we had crowdmark or something.",
      "Took this class during the Fall 2020 term where it was completely online due to COVID.\nThe marking scheme was 45% (3 term tests), 10% (participation), 15% Kritik (not optional) and 30% final exam. The marking scheme is very flexible for instance their is an option to have a 85% final exam and a 15% Kritik submission. Another one of the many options is 45% final exam, 15% Kritik, 10% participation, and 30% (2 term tests each 15%). \nTopHat is required to get the 10% participation marks but did not really use it that much to study.\nKritik is required and there are 6 assignments.\nThis course can seem hard at times  I did great on the first term test (79%) and got 60% on the next two term tests. Wait till your final mark and after the final exam to judge. Finished the class with 87 (better than expected). The final exam was fair it was very similar to the 3 practice term tests provided. Like 80% of the final exam was based on content after module 7.\nManaged perfectly fine without the model kit.\nBest tip to do good in this course is to do the practice questions over and over again. The lecture videos are also helpful.\nGood luck!\n",
      "Really hard, just really hard :( I passed with a decent grade because I aced the exam after a 4 day straight grind with no sleep. Do your kritik and ace it because that will save your mark too, same for tophat because a lot of questions will come from there. ",
      "I have mixed feelings about this course. On one hand, I hate it. I failed every single midterm (yes, all 3) and passed with a 70. (Although, I did study 10 days straight for the exam in hopes of getting a 50.) It was torture because the entire time I thought I'd fail the course. And it's not like I didn't try for the midterms, because I did try and I swear I did study. This course just takes so much time and effort and if you don't understand something in the beginning of the course, it just snowballs and you're seriously screwed. On the other hand, the content itself was interesting. ",
      "If I had a dime for every tear shed for this course, I would own Tesla. I think the combo of being really bad at chem and taking it online really took me out. I BARELY passed. Still passed tho :) ",
      "Took this course online due to COVID. Mark breakdown included two midterms that were 15% each, a 55% final exam, 5% optional Top Hat textbook quizzes, and 10% optional Kritik assignments. This course has multiple grading schemes that will produce the highest mark earned, including a 100% final exam option. Overall, this course is quite difficult if you don\u2019t take the time to practice and keep up with the content from the start. There are lots of concepts and fine details introduced in this course and it\u2019s really easy to fall behind if you don\u2019t dedicate a good amount of time to this course every week. A model kit isn\u2019t required to do well in this course, but you can benefit from purchasing one if you are more of a visual learner. There are many reactions that you learn in this course and it\u2019s much better if you actually understand the mechanism of each reaction rather than just memorizing the products it produces since it\u2019s very likely you will lose marks by picking the wrong answer on the multiple choice midterms and exam. Personally, I failed both midterms but thankfully passed the exam and course. I finished with the worst mark of my university career so far and I feel like I would\u2019ve done so much better if I followed the advice that I wrote above. ",
      "Everyone knows this is a killer course, the best advice is to do as many practice questions as possible. The content does come together towards the end of the course, so even if you're struggling in the beginning it is possible to succeed. Practice makes progress. It is possible to pass!",
      "Tbh it isn't as bad as people make it out to seem. Questions for midterms and finals were all taught in the lectures and it was p fair game. The only thing that really brought my mark down were careless mistakes which caused wrong products at the end. I don't think it's a hard course in terms of content it's just that it requires a lot of time and you have to be really careful in terms of the different reaction types.",
      "very very fair class as profs understand the stigma around organic chem and try to make it as easy as possible for students. no trickery, and very straightforward although some concepts are difficult to wrap your head around. make sure to go to class and do the practice tests ahead of the midterms",
      "Honestly really fun and interesting course. Good introduction to organic chemistry including nomenclature, drawing molecules, stereochemistry, and reactions. Although the course moves quickly, it isn't that hard if you practice, plus you get a cheat sheet for midterms and exams. It helps that the marking scheme is very forgiving and is adjusted to your benefit. I got the Kritik but not the textbook (which I think was like 15% extra marks). Looking back, I would have gotten both. Julie makes the course interesting and engaging with anecdotes about real life scenarios including pharmacology and disease.",
      "This course is the reason why I have to take a gap year and rethink my degree. If you want to do well in this course make sure you take it with courses with less load. Keep on top of your notes. Attend lectures. Keep asking question. Attend office hour. Forget about sleep and you just might pass. ",
      "Honestly, this course isn't as bad as everyone makes it out to be. Yes, the content can be difficult, but if you go to class and do the practice that is recommended, it is possible to do well. I would recommend buying the textbook in order to do the TopHat quizzes (bonus 5%) and completing the Kritiks (bonus 10%). The profs clearly care about the students, and want you to do well. The tests are fair, and they provide tests from previous years, along with the answers, in order to practice. Plus, you are allowed a double-sided cheat sheet for the tests and the final exam. I ended up doing better in this class than chem 120, and chem 123. The content was interesting, and leads into a lot of upper year courses.",
      "I'll put it like this. This course is not undoable. But it will need regular practice to do well, right from the beginning of the term. Trust me, do not wait until half way through the term to pick up the content seriously. If you lose your focus at any point, this course will steamroll you. ",
      "Organic chem is not that hard if you go to your lectures and put in the work to study consistently throughout the term. Midterms were really easy but the exam was a beast. Just don't fall behind and do all the assigned TopHat practice, that textbook will be your new bible.",
      "Tough course but do not listen to anybody who says you cant do it. Remember other people have gotten thru this course, just have to put the work in. What happens is that stuff starts to click but you need to put in a ton of hours.",
      "DO THE PRACTICE, read the course notes, textbook and watch the videos, grind the assignments to have a high grade going into the exam. All you need is a pass. ",
      "Professor Goll is amazing she obviously knows how to teach crazy concepts in the simplest terms. DO the Tophat questions and create a really good study sheet with the principles and one example. You can do it, just put the work in and it'll be history",
      "Professor Forsey was amazing! This class isn't as hard as people say. My tip for being successful in this course is to PRACTICE!!! Literally practice as much as possible and you'll be fine, I found the optimal amount of study time for this course is 10-14 hours a week. When I got home from a lecture, I found it helpful to summarize the lectures in my own words (as if I were to teach the course). "

      "Pretty cool, and no formal lab reports required!!",
      "Much easier than the course. The TAs and profs are generally very helpful and willing to answer any questions you may have. It's easy to succeed here and the labs are actually fun to do.",
      "Great complementary lab to the course. It reinforced concepts taught during CHEM 266. No lab final was a blessing.",
      "Sweet lab, you get to do a lot of cool stuff. There is a lot of waiting 30 minutes for the reaction to happen etc, but it's really neat some of the things that you get to do.",

      "Very fun lab, much better than CHEM 120L or 123L",
      "Lab reports are difficult",
      "No lab exam, which is awesome. The lab reports are all template style, which you download off of the course's LEARN profile and then just complete it by typing in the box or drawing stuff in the box. \n\nStick to the template font and stuff, otherwise you will get penalized. Marking of your lab reports varies by TAs, as some mark harder than others. But for the most part it's pretty easy to get at least an 80+ after the first template report when you get the hang of it. ",
      "This was a fun lab. The reports were time consuming and I was constantly disappointed with my marks but they werent terrible. No final exam which was nice and the TAs were super helpful.",
      "marta is bae",
      "Most difficult course that I have taken so far in my university career",
      "labs are worth 18% yikes but no final. my TA was a sass ball and marked really hard too so that was fun",
      "your typical lab, Marta was bomb. No final exam. all based on lab reports. You apply everything you learn in orgo 2 pretty much or at the least in a very basic level",
      "Great easy laboratory course! Intertwines with CHEM 266. Dr. Marta helps so much for lab reports!!! 90+ is very easy to achieve! ",
      "Easy course with lots of engagements with the lecture.",
      "loved it",
      "This was a great lab, not hard as long as you're keeping up in the class. Experiments are simple and follow the same timeline of what you're learning in lecture. Easy 90% exam if you put in a little effort. The actual lab reports were also fairly easy and only take a few hours to do. Not a stressful class at all. ",
      "So much fun! Incredibly interesting, and fun. Labs were very straight forward and really fair. Go to office hours and Marta is very helpful. No formal labs (which is amazing). Most labs were only 1 hour to 1 hour 30 mins long. ",
      "This was an awesome lab course (my favourite so far). The experiments are MUCH less stressful than those from general chemistry. The lab reports are all \"informal\" and fairly straightforward. ",
      "The lab was really enjoyable and pre-lab talks were super quick. Some of the labs related to the material being covered in lecture. This was great since it gave me a chance to really get a good understanding of the reaction. The lab reports were tricky to get everything that the TAs were looking for. ",
      "Very, very bird bi-weekly lab. 25% online pre-lab quizzes with two attempts, easy 100. 10% in-lab performance, easy high 90 or 100 unless you get really unlucky with your TA (the TAs are typically very chill in this lab). 65% divided across 5 lab reports that are due one week after the experiment, which you do and submit online. You have the option of submitting 1 report between you and your partner, so it's essential that you HAVE A GOOD PARTNER for this lab. It's best to plan ahead and take the same day/time as someone, rather than praying you find a random on the first day. Easy 90. ",
      "easiest lab you'll have at UW. way way better than chem 120L,123L. no final!! partners for post lab assignments that are not difficult (65%), prelabs are easy 100s and lab performance is easy 100s (combined 35%). the course is hard so they have mercy on the lab lol",
      "Easiest lab I've taken. TAs were super nice and it was fun to do.",
      "I took this course in Fall 2019. The instructors for this course were Leanne Racicot and Braden John Kralt. The mark breakdown of this course is as follows: 10% performance grade, 15% online pre-lab quizzes with two attempts each, and 75% informal lab reports spread across multiple experiments. No final exam. This is a bi-weekly lab and there are 5 experiments in total. Unlike CHEM 120L and CHEM 123L, there is no lab manual for this course. Everything is completely online. The performance grade (like the general first-year chemistry labs) is out of 10 for each experiment and it is generally very easy to get full marks as long as you a) work safely, b) are able to recover the product, and c) include everything that is required for the procedure summary (more on this in a bit). Before each lab session, you are required to read a procedure workbook (which again, is online). It contains all the instructions and background info you will need, as well as questions that you will need to answer via Mobius. You are allowed two attempts for each procedure workbook. The first page of each procedure workbook contains very general directions, but some will specify certain things that you MUST include in your procedure summary (or else you will lose marks for your lab performance grade for that experiment). For example, the last 3 experiments required you to draw the reaction mechanism for what was going on in the experiment, as well as any specific quantities needed (marked for completion only). The lab reports for CHEM 266L are completely different from the first-year courses. They are all informal and template style, meaning that you download each page and type/draw your answers into the text boxes provided. However, do not alter the font size or enlarge the box sizes or else you will be penalized for it. The due date is always one week after you've completed the experiment at 4:00 pm via Crowdmark. Depending on how familiar you are with the concepts and questions asked, it could take you anywhere from a couple of hours to multiple days to complete them. I found some of the questions to be quite challenging as they really test your creative thinking and knowledge, and people generally didn't do too well on them (high 60s to low 70s averages for each report, at least for my section). One other thing to note is that the TAs who mark your answers are EXTREMELY picky about what you must include for each question (each TA marks a different page so that the marks are more fair). For many of the concept based questions, it's either you get full marks for the question, or no marks. The labs in general were extremely fun to do and most shouldn't take more than a couple of hours each. The TAs and lab instructors (we had two, so the other one took over starting with experiment 4) were very chill, so don't be afraid to ask them questions. I didn't find this lab as easy as other students who have taken it in the past said it was, but it definitely isn't a back breaker, either. Not too difficult to finish with 80+. P.S. Since it's an organic chemistry lab, you'll smell nicely of organic solvent ;)",
      "lab reports are long and due in a week on crowdmark after your lab. lost so many marks on very picky things , and questions with unclear instructions. Not as easy as people say, possibly because marta was not the lab instructor. took with leanne racicot",
      "Took it in Fall 2020 online, but it was already mostly online before covid, so (I think) the only significant difference this term was that we never actually performed the experiments in person. 5% participation (just read the online workbooks and answer a few questions, unlimited attempts), 5% for a few small assignments, 20% pre-lab quizzes (relatively straightforward, best out of 2 attempts), 5% final quiz (no actual exam), and 65% lab reports. The lab reports are just answering a series of questions (explanation/calculations/drawing mechanisms), and they're a lot less work than traditional lab reports. However, these questions sometimes require quite a bit of thinking, so make sure you actually understand what happens at every step of the experiment. Class discussion board was on Top Hat (the same platform that the CHEM 266 textbook uses), and it wasn't the most convenient, but Leanne always encouraged discussion and did a great job of guiding you if you were confused about something. She was also very helpful in her 1-1 office hours, and she's super nice so don't be afraid to reach out to her if you're unsure of something or want clarification. \nNot the birdiest course ever, but still definitely one of my easiest courses this term. A pretty interesting addition to CHEM 266.",
      "Took this class online during the Fall 2020 term due to COVID with Leanne Raciot.\nThis class is not that hard especially since Dr. Raciot allowed students to work in pairs on the 5 lab reports.\nThe marking scheme was 5% participation (optional and Mobius quizzes for completion only), 20% pre-lab quizes (2 attempts each and the same questions), 5% kritik submissions (2 assignments were made optional later), 5% introductory assignment, 60% (or 65%) for the 5 lab reports and 5% final lab quiz.\nThe pre-lab quizzes were easy marks. The Kritik assignments were not hard, but it is hard to get perfect. The questions on the lab reports were fair and the final lab quiz was based on pre-lab and lab material and not hard. \nThis term was made easier since Dr. Raciot constantly uploaded videos of her office hours every week with hints on the lab reports.\nOverall, finished with a low 90.\n",
      "Brutal but still pretty helpful. ",
      "Took this class during Fall 2020 while it was all online. It was alright but it would've been 1000x better if we did it in person. Overall, I did enjoy it and it was rather easy. Not a bad thing to add on to your course load",
      "Took this course online due to COVID. Mark breakdown included 5 lab reports that totalled to 70% of your grade, pre-lab quizzes were worth 20%, 5% mobius participation marks, and a 5% final quiz. I feel that this course would be much better in person since it\u2019s not very fun to read PDFs of each lab and watch the instructor perform every step. The pre-lab quizzes were not difficult and could be done fairly quickly by referring to the lab manual pages. Lab reports were closely tied to the content in the CHEM 266 lecture course and it\u2019s key that you understand the concepts from that course so that it\u2019s much easier to complete the lab reports. ",
      "Very deceptive course. It seems very easy, but the TAs mark your lab reports as if you've committed a war crime against their beliefs. The Mobius quizzes were also super annoying. Pray that you get a good supervising TA. For the first lab I had a horrible TA, but the second one onwards, I got a very nice one. Overall, I HATED the course, even though the professor was nice."

I don't know why the average dropped from 266 but I'm guessing most people are lazy and people think they are better than they actually are. All questions were tested solely upon Chong's notes, Tophat, and the assignments. Legit,  a lot of people started complaining to make a petition to remove Chong and blamed him for bad marks; but if you looked at the midterms or final exams, every single question was tested on an idea from his course notes, assignments, and a few tophat stuff.

      "At first in the course everything will seem easy, especially compared to CHEM 266 material, but don't get used to that.

Its easy to fall behind in this course, so i would recommend reviewing while you do the weekly quizzes if you cant everyday. Do t lose your hope if you did bad in chem 266 or first midterm.

      "use the Tophat textbook if you got it from CHEM 266 it can be helpful. the class was more challenging than CHEM 266 but its not because of harder content, the profs just don't give good course notes or resources to help students like in 266. If you have Barra, understand the questions from assignments inside and out, the questions covered on midterms/exams are formatted in a similar manner and are often repeated.",
      "Best course ever! It was my most fun course this term. Depends on you prof. If it's Forsey, TopHat is the best, makes the most sense and lots of practice. \nIf it's Barra or Chong, read the course notes with open eyes and always attend lectures. It's the tiniest details they test. Especially when it comes to acids and bases. Pay attention to the mechanisms and WHY what is going on. ",

Why do they knock us down? do they not want us to succeed and get into our program of choice. Absolute Joke.",

And mind you, I did study for the midterm. At that point I started to put more into organic chemistry and highkey ignored all my other courses (one of the other courses I only watched the first 5 weeks of lectures). Ended with a low 70.

      "I found this course to be more fast-paced than chem 266 and the amount of reactions/mechanisms you had to memorize was pretty overwhelming. Steven Forsey was a good prof, you could tell he cared about his students because he made an effort to remember peoples names and was very chatty. I found his explanations could be a little scattered sometimes, but he was very patient with all the questions he would get from students. This is the lowest grade I've gotten in a course so far, but I still finished with an 82 so its really not as bad as people make it out to be. Because chem 266 was online, the midterm (25%) and final (55%) were open book (not sure if it will be this way for future terms tho). "

Studying for this course will be intense and you should making notes and reviewing them often to spot these interconnections - they are not clearly identified in lecture but are still important. The testing was awful... 50% of the midterm was determined by labelling 3 diagrams, same with the final. There was no indication of the level of detail he would test for certain concepts - sometimes you had to know how to draw every molecule in a pathway and its co-substrates, but sometimes it was more general. Dieckmann moved the weighting of the midterm to the final if you did better on the final - which also meant the final was worth 90%, so try and do well early on so this doesn't happen to you. Dieckmann is decent at answering questions, but the course notes are your bible. Practice drawing mechanisms over and over again. This is probably a good course to take if you're thinking of going into medicine, but would not advise taking this unless you have a couple easy electives to balance out your school term. "

It was a little math heavy, so it could be easy or difficult depending on how comfortable you are with that stuff. \n\nI took the course with Elizabeth Meiering online, and her lecture videos were pretty clear and comprehensive, but they could be a little dry. ",
      "This course was really interesting and straightforward if you're familiar with basic calculus, rate laws, and common experimental biochem techniques. However, be prepared to memorize the steps of derivations, which can get quite lengthy (1-3 pages long). The actual math was never difficult and mostly just algebra with maybe 1 or 2 steps that require basic calculus.",
      "Lovely course taught by a lovely prof. Unfortunately I only just started getting my health in order two weeks before the exam, so I can't speak to the entirety of the course because I feel now that I missed a lot of it. However, as someone who has had trouble with understanding a lot of biochemistry concepts(funny and a little pathetic for a third year student really), I must say taking this course did wonders at clarifying and reinforcing my understanding of (specifically for me) rates, enzyme kinetics, and applied math. Things I was having trouble retaining before. \n\nThe material itself is fairly heavy in derivations and digs deeper at the mechanisms behind a lot of experimental concepts and equations from previous courses(think rates, enzymes, electrophoresis, thermo). That being said, Dr. Meiring does really well at organizing this information in a way that is easy to understand and build on. Most of the newer ideas and solutions to problems were explained in a methodical, sequential way. \n\nThe amount of content(I didn't understand) was intimidating at first, but since the information you need to know is laid out clearly, I ended up finding it easier to understand the reasoning behind the ideas than to memorize the derivations, even at a time crunch.   \n\n(To understand the derivations and equations being discussed, I found it helped to translate the steps that were detailed in the notes(Dr. Meiring posts notes, bless her. My tablet writing is atrocious) to verbal English(they lend well to that). \n\nAs much as the concepts are straightforward, the applications of the information are diverse in a way that can make for challenging questions in assessment(relevant and fair, but not the easiest to figure out on the fly!). From my impression of the way Dr. Meiring describes her assignments and exams, she's pretty aware of this and communicates the angles she assesses from in lecture and review. Don't miss them. \n\n(Ergo, someone who is studying regularly, as opposed to under a self imposed time crunch, will not feel like they're figuring things out on the fly)\n\nOther than that, the math really isn't that bad. It looked a lot at first but it got easier as the applications become more recognizable. This is coming from someone who doesn't remember anything from MATH128. Course content that I did find familiar was from CHEM233/L and CHEM 221(for which my instructor had a biochemistry background)."

There's a lot more arrow-pushing but the last unit on organometallics will blow your mind because your doing things you can't normally do with organic materials. It's a great course because it teaches you the organic chemistry behind a lot of protein-substrate interactions. You kind of have to find the application though.

The last unit organometallics (Fillion's specialty), doesn't really require understanding. Just know the movements in the cycles and you're good to go! The exam was surprisingly easy and brought up everyone's marks by 4-5%.\nThe tutorial is very useful (he sometimes uses it as a fourth hour of class), and there's a participation quiz that has really helpful questions for the midterms/exams (plus you get a minimum of 70% no matter what!).\nFor the midterms, definitely find old tests as they are not super hard but it's a long midterm in only one hour - definitely was rushed for time. \nOverall, I thought the easiest of all the orgo courses I've taken.

      "Interesting aspects of the course. Really useful if you want to pursue anything more really organic or biochem related in life. ",

I found writing out the detailed mechanism part of the midterms were much easier than trying to identify the final product and reagents simply because it just make sense for me. The second part of the midterms were more challenging because he just want the final answer and you might not have enough time to try to figure out how to get to it. For some, it might just click and for others it might not. Therefore, it splits the easiness level in half.",

      "This was a challenging course but if you practice you can do incredibly well. Dr. Murphy is one of, if not the best, professor I've ever had. He knows everyone's name by the second week, and expects a lot out of his students but he gives you all of the resources to succeed. The midterm took a lot of people by surprise, but the more you practice and move beyond mass spec, the better the course gets. The assignments are challenging, but worth doing yourself if you want to do well. Make sure to time yourself  while doing them so that you're on track for the exam. I finished with a mid-70 after failing the midterm, but i had friends that finished in the 85+ range after getting 50% on the midterm. ",

      "I personally really liked the way the course was taught. In class, we learned more symbols than what was in the textbook that was interesting (such as the directions north, east, etc) and how to count numbers. We didn't have to know these extra symbols for the exam, however. The actual course content only contains of about 200 symbols throughout the whole term which isn't a lot. It can be intimidating at first, and yes, in the beginning it seems like pinyin is hard to remember and you feel like you are writing random symbols. After 50 or so symbols, you see repeated symbols within other symbols and it helps with memorization. There is a little learning curve in the beginning but you get over it. The course in the spring consists of a midterm, oral skit, and a final exam. Other terms don't have a midterm and just quizzes instead of a midterm. The midterm has pinyin dictation but the final doesn't so it's possible to get a really good grade in this course. The marking is very lenient and yes this is a bird course (provided you put in some effort).  The midterm and final was very easy, both were 2 page double sided.

I ended up doing that by the end because of how depressing/hostile the environment was. I haven't dreaded seeing a faculty member of a school that much since the mean lunchroom ladies at my middle school. She's far too moody to be teaching.

For one, in CIVE400 we were urged not to do a lot of design work and moreso the \"qualitative\" research part of the project. This is a trick, do as much as you can from the start or you will feel the burn in 401.\n\nYour topic and the scope of your topic really have no limitations outside of what you deem is appropriate, and this can be dangerous because no one will tell you if it is too much. For civils, there's not a lot of \"innovation\" that you'll find yourself doing that will be comparable to the SEs, ECEs, Mech kids and etc. My advice: pick a topic and define a MANAGEABLE amount of work so you don't screw yourself over later. If you're not trying to redefine the entirety of civil engineering and do something simple with your project - you will have a good time. If you're a high flyer and want to design something really insane then I wish you luck: time management and organization are your best friend."

Prof. Zurell has a project in this course where you have to design a small structure made of timber and I thought it was pretty cool cus it resembles what you might deal with in a real-life industry situation.

      "Birdy. Took this W2021. The professors and TA were active online which I respect. I do find mythology fascinating but I guess I would enjoy reading them in my own time instead. Highly recommend if you are looking for an elective to fulfill your requirement or just want to take a super chill class",
      "Really interesting course. There were only 4 midterms so it wasn't too stressful. ",
      "Entire class was split into four tests worth 25%. No assignments otherwise. Lots of reading, which is to be expected in a mythology course, as well as some videos which were supplemental and optional. I wish we had some more assignments - having my grade rest on just four tests was very stressful to the point where it almost felt unfair. But, as someone who loves mythology, the course content was interesting and Dr Kroeker was a fun prof who seemed to thoroughly enjoy what he was teaching, which made the course engaging. ",
      "Easy when you can google everyting and not learn",
      "Easy course.",
      "Quite literally, very enjoyable course if you like Mythology and whatnot, I would also classify it as a bird course, so long as you follow the modules that they post online you should be able to get most of the marks on the online quizzes... we had no final exam for this course which was super neat! ",
      "This is an 'easy' course in terms of how the questions are phrased/how easy it is to score well, but I genuinely would not recommend it as a bird course unless you have a strong interest in or decent knowledge of mythology. \n\nThe weekly readings are long and listless, structured strangely and virtually impossible to keep up with (60+ pages each week). Contrary to what some people say, you still need to read or skim a good portion of them to keep up with the general gist of what's going on - not everything is instantly Googleable or ctrl-f-able + the short 35 min time limits of every test can actually make them a bit stressful. \n\nIf you want a real (and actually enjoyable/low-effort) bird course, take MUSIC 140, CS 100 or a 101 language course. ",
      "The breakdown for the online class was 4 term test, 25% each, content-wise it's very textbook heavy, at least for the term I took it. I barely did the readings though and still did the quizzes pretty easily, however, in all honesty, if the class is in-person I probably wouldn't recommend it because it is A LOT of content to remember.",

      "soft ball for us percy jackson fans",
      "Free 90+. Literally the easiest course at this school. The format was 4 online multiple choice tests weighted 25% each.",
      "bird course. altho try to find the test bank (but some answers are wrong on there so u have to cross check with the textbook, just ctrl f). 25% x 4 term tests",
      "Nice class about greek and roman mythology, comprised of 4 online tests, 25% each. Some questions were a little dense but the overall class was nice to take",
      "You know why you're taking this course. You get exactly what you signed up for. ",
      "This would've been much more fun if the prof and TA's were helpful. The weekly modules often required 70-100+ pages to read from the textbook but none of it was that fundamental for the tests (only few specific questions about the text were asked). The pre-test tutorials weren't based on content for the tests so they weren't helpful. you are given 35 mins for 40 questions (4 tests). overall easy but not the fun course i thought it was going to be.",
      "I studied 0 hours for this course and got a 97\u2026 There are 4 online quizzes where you are allowed 35 minutes to complete, each weighted 25% and they reuse the same questions every year from a test bank. If you can get your hands on the test bank (not that hard, it can be done through Discord or Reddit), you should be fine. The material itself is pretty interesting if you\u2019re into Greek Mythology or Percy Jackson. Still, if you are just looking for the easiest bird course ever, here it is. You could easily do this course over co-op, and there are modules + a textbook you are supposed to follow but with the test bank, it is not even necessary. TAs also hold Kahoot help sessions occasionally. Also, if you are in engineering, this is the PERFECT mark booster and class to take the load of your term.",
      "bird",
      "Even if you don't do anything, cram before the tests and exams you'll get an 80 or higher. If you want a 90 you have to try and memorize dates and specific geographical locations in relation to each other since they ask random very specific questions on the exam that'll make you hate the prof.",
      "Took online, super light course",
      "Not that easy if you're not interested in cheating. Lots of readings compared to the courses I'm used to for my program, which have little reading. If you're already familiar with, or really like, Greek Mythology then it's probably pretty easy, but for me I find language courses to be a better elective. Don't skip out on the textbook, the modules are not enough.",
      "Easy course",
      "bird",
      "By far the easiest course I've taken (and I try to take all the bird courses). 2h total over the entire term for 95+. No joke",
      "This was a very easy online course. If you are interested in Greek and Roman mythology, you will enjoy this class very much. \n\nI took this course during the pandemic in 2022. There were four open-book tests, each 25%. There were a few tricky questions as it asks about specific quotes and details about key figures, but you will do well if you just complete the readings and attend the TA review sessions. The TAs used Kahoot and gave us practice questions similar to what would appear on the actual tests. ",
      "Well known as a bird course. I took this during the Fall 2022 term and there were 4 tests worth 25% each about every 3 weeks. There is a lot of content to go through with the textbook and module readings but it's very doable if you put in a couple hours per week into the course. The questions on the tests are fairly straightforward with a couple of specific questions about quotes and events that require you to think a little bit. Overall, very easy online course that can almost guarantee a high mark. "

This course is really fun and the content is really interesting as you look at comics, video games, and movies. The discussion posts are an easy 15%. The two midterms are not very challenging they have MC, FIB, Matching, and Identify/Define but no Long or Short answer written response questions. The creative writing assignment is kinda hard as the instructions are so broad and Dr. Hardiman did not really talk about the assignment that much. Overall, finished with a low 90, which is less than my marks in the previous CLAS courses I have taken CLAS 201 (mid 90) and CLAS 104 (high 90) with Dr. Hardiman also. If you are looking for a bird course to get an easy 90 THIS COURSE IS NOT IT. Getting an 80+ is easy though if you attend classes. There are no online notes so attendance is necessary.

The Term Tests are based mostly on lecture material and include text book material. The Term Tests include MC, FIB and Long Answer questions. The assignments are based on comparing movies like 300 with ancient sources. The final exam was completely long answer with NO MC. Overall, finished with a high 90.

      "i would highly recommend taking clas 100 first. this course overlaps quite a lot with clas 100, it gives you a super basic overview of several parts of ancient greece although the tests (of which there were three) were difficult. they were very long tests and some of the questions expected you to know things that were not elaborated on or even taught in class. having clas 100 under your belt will give you the knowledge needed to fill in the gaps left in this course, and pass the tests. readings were also dense, the textbook ('classics in translation') is from the 1950s, they were long readings and you read herodotus, aeschylus, thucydides, plutarch, etc. but the subject matter itself is interesting, especially if you already have an interest in ancient greece."

For roughly three centuries, until the suicide of the Ptolemaic queen Cleopatra VII in 30 BC, the Egyptians lived under an alien ruling authority of Hellenic heritage.  Furthermore, they lived and worked alongside numerous immigrants of the same heritage, immigrants who appear to have benefited frequently from the differential laws, practices, and institutions that favoured them and did nothing for the native people of Egypt.  Yet at the same time, a study of Ptolemaic Egypt reveals also a pattern of increasing assimilation between Greeks and Egyptians. Such assimilation was not solely the result of increasing mutual tolerance and respect.  Indeed, the history of Greco-Macedonian relations with the Egyptians demonstrates that whatever respect and privileges the ruling classes ultimately granted to the natives of Egypt were at least in part the result of violent Egyptian assertiveness, in the form of armed rebellion.  The history of interactions between Greeks and Egyptians in Ptolemaic Egypt offers an unmatched opportunity for the examination of the relations between rulers and ruled, of the clash between ethnic groups, and of the forces that lead to reception on the one hand and resistance on the other.",

However, it quickly starts delving into more mathematically rigorous details which may get a little hard if you don't stay on top of things ",
      "This was by far my hardest course of the semester, but I also learned the most from it. Although I consistently spent 15+ hrs/week on this course, the concepts I learned from this course changed the way I optimize things in my daily life. The Fall 2021 offering was very fair (top 5 of 8 assignments for 50%, 4 quizzes for 20% and a 30% final which you must pass to pass the course). ",
      "One of the most enjoyable advanced math courses that I ever took at Waterloo, the term I took it, I felt they were going way too much into CO255 content... and some questions on assignments were downright unanswerable....\n\nI spent significant amount of time on the assignments, definitely budget much time for this, alongside learn Latex or use OneNote to type up the assignments because I DO NOT recommend hand-writing for this at all...\n\nI was able to see the practical application of this course at one of my co-ops, but honestly the math of optimization was quite fun, however one of the hardest courses I have ever taken yet ",
      "CO250 is definitely a very interesting course. For the winter term, the class consisted of 3 midterms, clicker questions, weekly assignments (excluding weeks where a midterm took place), and a final exam. Given covid, the clicker questions were dropped, along with a single midterm.\n\nThe assignments are quite difficult relative to the content, however they are doable within the week (or sooner if you are inclined to do so). Otherwise the content was straightforward and was really interesting! There is quite a bit of content on graphs, perhaps MATH239 might be of assistance, but is not necessary to complete the course with a good grade.",
      "I came into this course expecting the worst based on past reviews, but they must have changed the course a bit Winter 2022 term because the content was straightforward and lectures we're not very long (I took online course). I would definitely recommend taking online if you can since there we're maybe 20 minutes of lectures/week for the first 3 weeks. The assignments were lengthy and difficult, but manageable if you start a few days ahead. Final in-person exam was very reasonable and fair. I actually quite enjoyed this course, and it does require some basic math 136 knowledge although not very extensively. ",
      "HARD course. Only offering a simple example but asks us to solve hard questions. A questions takes a whole page in assignment. I took it only so only assignments and meetings, participation are considered into mark. ",
      "I thought the content was actually kind of interesting, but they made the quizzes (worth 15% each) and exams really long for the amount of time allotted.",
      "Took this course Spring 2022 in-person. Final mark consisted of 9 assignments (20%), 3 quizzes (more like tests since they were each worth 15%), and the final exam (35%). The content was very useful, but the course was hard to wrap your head around. There were lots of subtle theoretical mathematics behind the concepts of the course. The quizzes and final exam were too difficult to finish without rushing, given the time allotted.",
      "Super interesting introductory course on optimization. While the concepts seem daunting at first, with practice they begin to be intuitive. I took this in Spring 2022 online, so 20% assignments (lowest dropped), 3 x 10% online quizzes (multiple choice and short answer questions within 50 minutes) and a 50% in-person final. The assignments are challenging but satisfying, however, they require a significant amount of time to complete (around 6-8 hours). The quizzes were difficult given the short time frame, as there were many tricky conceptual questions. The final was much better, and we were allowed to bring a formula sheet that we prepared (1 page double sided). Overall, a really enjoyable course!",
      "Tough course but not unbearable. No weighted exam passing requirement is huge and in general I was the least worried about passing this course, despite it being one of the harder ones. Pei's lectures are great but the professors, him included, have no mercy on the students and don't seem to care about anything beyond the lectures. ",
      "Be advised to pay enough efforts and time on this course otherwise students could easily fail this course. Students are expected to master the proofs thoroughly and do calculation accurately and quickly. It is suggested to study in groups or ask the professors frequently. Quizzes are the most challenging part since the scheduled time is always very tight. ",
      "Unpopular opinion: pick up the required textbook from the WUSA second-hand store. You will save 3hr/week from the lectures. Plus it's a good reference for doing the assignments, because the questions either ask you to do some similar computations as done in the examples, or prove something straight from a definition in the book. And because this is a popular course, you will never worry about reselling the book afterwards.",

      "Relatively difficult but not super hard as long as you go to lectures and read the textbook (very useful textbook).  ",
      "A tough but necessary course. Be sure to brush up on your linear algebra skills.",
      "Overall I thought the course was very interesting. Everything felt logical and could be reduced to simple steps which helped me understand the content. Some of the assignments were a bit tough but that is to be expected. Final was very reasonable if you studied and understood the course content. Last 2 chapters (cutting planes and KKT theorem) felt rushed but they weren't very long so you could review them yourself.",
      "Overall the course is interesting. Many useful methods are taught for linear, integral, and nonlinear programming. The difficulty of the exams and assignments is acceptable. \nHowever, the lecture is sick. Prof. Henry's lecture note is hard to catch up with. The other instructor's lecture is always full, which needs to get a seat previously. I learned most concepts by reading the textbook, searching on Youtube, and going to Prof. Henry's office hours. The tutorial is also sick. The TA has a strong accent and terrible handwriting. Also, her logic is a little bit hard to catch up with. Therefore, prepare for self-learning.",
      "lots of content but all of it is connected to each other, making it easier to understand. attend class and study and you should be fine.",
      "The first part of the course on formulation was probably the most important part. Just being able to translate these situations into programs is useful. The majority of the course was linear programs and duals which was kinda boring but useful for IPs which are harder. Assignments were medium, quizzes were fair, final was fine.",
      "Took this online on a study term. Weekly assignments were worth 20% total, 3 online quizzes 10% each, in-person final 50%. The assignments took me a loooong time every week and were usually a combo of proofs and computations. However, they were really helpful and definitely solidified my understanding. I wouldn't take this course over co-op even though it's online because of the workload. The quizzes were fine but the final was nothing like I expected, it was very conceptual in nature but I studied all the algorithms and computations instead :( In terms of content, it was very interesting and sparked my interest in optimization. The lecture videos were sometimes too long and tedious for my liking (and the voice is very monotonous), but the slides are well-done and I referred back to them a lot when studying. The profs were helpful and very responsive on Piazza.",
      "Decent course. Weekly assignments (20%) with 3 quizzes (45%) and a final (35%). I found assignments/quizzes difficult as they use some unintuitive notation sometimes. Recommend reviewing a little bit of linear algebra as you're expected to know the basics (basis, matrix multiplication, rank, determinant, etc)",
      "Pretty interesting topics, workload is distributed pretty evenly and it's doable over co-op. Assignment questions were a bit tricky and required some thinking.",
      "Did CO250 in Fall 2022. \nContent was cool to learn but a lot of random things you could trip up on. Also the final was the size of a Harry Potter book. ",
      "One of my favourite courses in undergrad. You basically learn how to formulate optimization programs, and learn some methods on solving them. In terms of difficulty, it's not nearly as hard as its reputation suggests, but the assignments take forever to complete. ",

      "Really need time and be bold to ask large number of questions, and good profs.",
      "assignments are nightmare fuel (but they're only worth 1% each so it's not even worth the effort) but the quizzes and exams are child's play ",
      "Assignments were pretty challenging and I honestly stopped trying because I couldn't finish them. Tests and final exam were not that difficult comparably. The course was more computational than expected and there were quite a few different topics discussed throughout the course. Overall, the course was quite fun, moderately challenging (but not that hard) and a decent introduction to optimization, I would recommend it.  "

We covered the usual CO 250 content in the first half of the course, then went over some topics in continuous and convex optimization (which felt very calculus/analysis-leaning). We had weekly assignments with 4 questions each, which were usually pretty straightforward (unusually so for an advanced 200-level course). The midterm was a brutal time crunch, but a lot of the questions were from the practice midterm. The prerequisites were definitely needed for the class, and if you took MATH 237, there are some topology concepts that were assumed to have already been covered in MATH 247 but weren't covered in MATH 237 (balls, closed sets, compactness, accumulation points).

      "Very difficult course with Martin Pei. Along with a straightforward lecture review, we had three weekly, difficult, rigorous proof questions. Despite starting as early as possible for majority of these questions, I would be working on them for most of the day, every day up until the due date and still not be able to fully finish one or two. While Martin Pei's lectures were superb (as usual), they almost never provide any direction whatsoever for any of the proof questions. Rather, they state a basic definition or a key theorem we need to use *somewhere* in the proof. Many of the proof questions require a lot of creative thinking, to the point where reading the posted solutions is mind-blowing (mostly in a negative way). The proofs had a seemingly rigid, unique grading scheme which was supposed to assign a grade based on the quality of your proof, rather than specific marks for whether you included something from the model solution. On paper, this sounded really nice, yet in practice, I would get wildly different results. Complete proofs which were correct except for maybe one major logical flaw near the end would receive 30% (which is explicitly stated to be for partial solutions). Meanwhile, actual partial solutions which were outright missing key information would receive, in some cases, 80% (which is stated to be what their posted model solutions get...?). Moreover, the feedback for the proofs would be very lackluster. If your solution deviates from the posted solution, don't expect to get an explanation as to what you did incorrectly. That being said, take this course if you want to improve your proof-writing skills in strides, but be prepared for some of the hardest proof questions you have likely encountered up until this point, and also expect your interest in Graph Theory to fizzle out by the end.

      "I found this course very interesting, with difficult but fun proof problems. Prof. Pei has a great sense of humour and his lectures were well-structured. We had a very strange grading scheme that took into account the clarity of your proof, with the result that the average on many problems was 50-60%, but we must've gotten boosted or something because my final grade ended up okay.",

Instead, classes are taught by referring us to units in the text book which itself is extremely dense and unintuitive at times. \n\nAssignments are difficult and no full solution set is posted as post mortem.

It's structured in a non-traditional way; there are no weekly lectures, rather there are full course notes and links to Martin Pei's videos. The professor states exactly which pieces of content are relevant for the current week's assignment. It was clear to me that the professor cared more about students actually learning the course content instead of attempting to maintain some arbitrary class average through insanely difficult and time-consuming assessments. The course requires mild, but consistent effort. The assignments were enjoyable and well-designed; the purpose seemed to be to really push us to dig into the proofs in the course notes, reinforce the topics, and build some intuition. If you've taken any other C&O course with a difficult professor, these assignments will seem much easier, mostly because the others are overtuned. The notation in the course notes was mildly annoying to parse through at times, but it was serviceable nonetheless. Heavily dependent on the professor; Martin Pei's course is structured entirely differently with much more difficult assessments. Also, Joseph Cheriyan gives very thorough and helpful Piazza responses, the most I've ever seen. Granted, he is very strict regarding Piazza posting etiquettes (namely, private posts).",
      "took it online with joseph cheriyan. there were weekly assignments+tutorials+quizzes and three tests in the term. course is very interesting with a fair amount of work. the prof really cared about you actually learning the stuff. basically learnt a bunch of algorithms to solve different types of transshipement problems. good stuff.

I signed up for UW Flow just to leave this review. \n\nI heard TAs and the Prof laughing at my question I asked during the office hour. Instructor apologized for it, but she made an excuse that it was to discuss where students are struggling at.\n\nFurthermore, for all students, this instructor does not care. If we ask for something, then prof always says \"I don't have time, it's not possible\". We are genuinely asking for minimum to post the notes before class, but said it's not possible. Every other profs does it, but why can't she? \n\nNotes are also unclear, examples given in the class is not useful; she pretends she tries to come up with a good example, but not at all; she picks examples that is CONVENIENT FOR HER.\n\nWe have biweekly quizzes AND biweekly assignments. IMO, this workload is way too heavy, and personally quizzes is not a good method to be assessed with; I always do bad on the exams. But this prof had to make the quizzes worth 2x more than the assignments. Assignments are way too hard, it took me all week to finish it. Because of that, I could not do any other course and I am doing poor on other courses because of this. I am guaranteed to fail this course. Wrong answer during the office hour, bad support for students outside of class, hard assignments, hard quizzes. \n\nI tried to discuss the issues with the course I am experiencing, but the prof blamed EVERY. SINGLE. PROBLEMS. ON ME. It's unbelievable - this prof is not professional at all. IMO she disqualifies as an instructor, \n\nI wish I dropped out of her course in the beginning of the term. I am thinking about reporting the prof to CO department.

The assignments are decently difficult and time consuming but also fair; the assignment with a median of 28% on it had some of the harder problems treated as bonuses, and it was only worth 2.5%, so take that how you will. The programming assignments are new to the course compared to previous offerings, and although they are all-or-nothing, the difficulty wasn't that bad, and we were given two weeks for each of them! Thanks for the TAs for answering all my questions.\n\nThe final consisted of mostly computation and proofs we learned in class, with some other questions that can be solved if you understood part of an algorithm's proof (k-median) and used a little inequality trick and also rigorously prove one of the programming assignments. A proof list was given (proofs to understand for the final) as well as areas of focus. Overall, if you read the course notes and got a basic grasp of the techniques and/or some intuition with the graphs/matroids/algorithms, the course is passable, and if you went deeper the course should have been nice, although a little difficult sometimes, it does teach you how to problem solve very effectively, albeit by getting thrown in the lion's den.

It was nice to see how more computationally complex problems could be solved. In terms of content, it was mainly focused on CO 250 content with some extensions, with little detailed theory. I'm sure this course can be very prof-dependent, but I found it to be quite easy and manageable (with Laurent Poirrier).",

That being said, having maturity in algebra (like having taken an algebra course before) would be really useful -- and is much more essential than the combinatorics counterpart of the course. This is also a professor dependent course. Prof. Oliver decided to dedicated more time on posets rather than species for our offering. In general, we discussed partial ordered sets, algebra of power and laurent series, OGFS, q-integers and q-binomials, (minimal) category theory for enumeration, species theory and its EGFS, mobius functions on posets, group theory and representation theory in the end. The species part were so abstract and confusing that even Wikipedia had the wrong definition.

After offering an overview of the field of environmental communication, it will engage in an analysis of key issues regarding the role of the media in relation to the environment, such as \"social license to operate,\" the role of alternative media practices, and the environmental impact of media systems themselves. The course will consider a range of different media genres in relation to the environment (e.g., public relations, governmental communication, news media, social media, NGO campaigns, documentaries). What are the primary objectives and strategies of different forms of environmental communication and how do these various media shape public understanding of environmental issues?",

The tedious thing are the labs as they are short but require a bit of effort especially as a science student with all the labs, though your TA's can usually help you. Though the labs are only worth 5% so legit if you miss one it doesn't matter but it does give you practice so you don't really need to study as much for exams.

      "Awesome course, isn't too difficult like CS 135, but actually teaches you some good things. If you're looking for a not too difficult CS course, this is it right here. Make sure to leave a few hours aside to get through the assignments, they can be a bit tricky. Easy exams.",
      "Good course for my first CS course.",
      "Weekly assignments are not worth much, but are difficult. Weekly labs. 1 midterm, 1 final. Doing the labs will greatly help with the assignments. Asking questions to TAs and prof  will help a lot.",
      "I had no programming experience before this class and it still wasn't too hard for the most part. A good elective. Some assignments were tricky but the exams were easy.",
      "The course was relatively easy, but the midterm was setup poorly - the focus was not on core concepts but on the exactness of the stepping problems, which I don't think is useful at all.",
      "For someone with no history in writing programs this was a very cool course. Lectures were difficult to pay attention to but I liked the overall skill set I came out of the course with. Also learned that coding can be very frustrating (you can easily get stuck at a road block for significant amounts of time) yet very rewarding (no better feeling than finally getting your program to run)",

      "Read the coursenote and only go to class for clicker questions",
      "People who like computer science will like this course.",
      "Really easy course. Especially if you have coded before. Assignments get a little harder at the end but both the midterm and finals were easy. The only thing I hated about this course was how annoying using Dr. Racket can be at times.",
      "Elementary course in CS. Have fun!",
      "Reviewing as a science major, this course was definitely the one that set me up with programming. Even though it was Dr. Racket, concepts were easy to follow. Be sure to go ask a lot of questions if you do not understand.",
      "Thanks to Keiko Katsuragawa, the prof who doesn't know how to type properly or speak English at a comprehensive level, I can't stand this easy CS course. Very prof dependent, but generally easy. ",

      "I have never coded before so i opted to take this rather than CS135. This was really easy for me. I'm glad I took it though becuase it saved time so I can focus more on actual courses for my major (MATH145, PHYS121 etc). Don't expect to be able to code anything after this, especial since you use dr Raket. And the design recipes are a pain, my tip is put 20 test cases for everything.",

My best friend tutors this class and I still justtttt scraped by. language is not super useful in life. many of my friends have taken this course because they heard it was easy and ended up failing.",

      "Trivial course.",
      "Take CS 135 or 145 if you have prior programming experience. The majority of this course is exceedingly easy if you already know programming basics. It may only possibly get difficult at the very end. The design recipe and templates are the hardest thing for the majority of the course.",
      "CS 115's content wasn't too hard and is very accessible to first time coders. Be prepared to  sometimes have to put in a good chunk of time for the weekly assignments, but the assignments help you out a lot with problem solving skills and becoming more comfortable with coding in general.",

      "It you get stuck on an assignment, take a break and revisit later. Don't let assignments become a time-sink.",

      "A good start in cs though Racket seems useless in the future study...",
      "Pretty easy course overall! I stopped going to labs about three weeks in and still managed to get the bonus 3%. The assignments were relatively easy (with one  or two exceptions).",
      "It's hard to motivate yourself to do the assignments when each is 2% or something, but it really is important to keep on top of it. They only get harder and arguably the only way to guarantee that you'll do well on the midterm (since you WILL be asked to write mini programs) I personally found the exam to be much harder than the midterm, so you really need to use the midterm as a grade booster. ",
      "Very easy course if you keep up with the material and do the assignments.",
      "Must attend lectures if you're new to programming.",
      "Really easy. I had no previous coding experience and I picked it up the concepts super quickly. You have to go to class though. Slides are NOT enough",
      "Not an \"EASY\" course at all. Anyone commentating that is probably a Math/Eng student who is already familiar with coding through other courses. Since the midterm/exam is on paper, you have to be able to imagine what your code is going to be able to do without actually testing it  like you do in your assignments! Speaking of assignment, they're bloody hard! No joke, it might take you an entire day to problem solve your way through them and that might not even be enough - incredibly frustrating course and not recommended unless you really want to study coding in the future. DR. Racket is not even applicable to most organizations. If you want to learn coding, just pick up something off Amazon or get a pdf through a friend - don't spend money here unless you're actually planning on continuing studies in CS.",
      "The education quality is significantly impaired with no doubt since we are doing it online. Reviews before COVID was mostly positive. But after COVID-19, a lot of them are negative. I think that reflects something. Assignment were thrown into your face like you just have one class for the whole term. For me, I believe the material we learn and the assignment we need to do is inconsistent in terms of difficulty level. The gap between them is just huge. It often took me eight to twelve hours to finish the assignment. Don't take this if you are doing online.",
      "The end of the course became quite tough but otherwise this was pretty manageable. Excellent professors and ISA's who always take our feedback and concerns into consideration to make the course experience better, including having office hours very late at night and very early in the morning. The online platform is also excellent and fun to use.",
      "It was okay. All I can say is, do your work and submit assessments on time. Please don't procrastinate. That's what I did, and I live to regret it. This is because figuring out the solutions to each assessment problem takes time, and procrastinating doesn't help. So, submit early. Submit often. Submit. Submit.",
      "It's the worst course ever, online especially. They are least interested to teach. They just provided the content to read by ourselves. I wouldn't suggest anyone to take this course online. ",
      "I think this course ran well online, the notes were very organized and easy enough to follow along and there is good support from most of the proffs and tas. The course may be a little fast for a complete cs beginner but the course has 400+ practice questions to help prepare for the weekly assignments\n",
      "This was joint taught by a bunch of profs in the Winter term and I think it was one of the most organized online courses I took. The content modules were all written but there was a bunch of integrated questions to check your understanding. The course is really centered on your ability to reach out for help when you need it since everything was asynchronous. I think my favourite part was how office hours were 1-on-1 and there were a lot of times available throughout the day. The only thing is that some of the nicer TAs had really long wait times lol. Overall super enjoyable though, just make sure to base your design recipe on their given examples or you will lose many marks ",
      "I found the online for this course to be fantastic personally. The EDx is clearly organized, and the content isn't too difficult, but provides a challenge. Can't speak to the in-person, but would definitely recommend the online. Beware though as this course is time consuming because of the amount of problems and assignments and shouldn't be mixed with a term that is already fairly difficult. ",
      "I took this course online due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so my review is based on a remote, online learning experience. Overall, as someone who is not a CS student and who doesn't have a lot of background experience and knowledge in programming, it's a great introductory course to the language of Racket and the overall concepts that will be useful in later computer science courses. The Racket language itself is not a very \"useful\" language that you may or may not use in later CS courses and even in a job, but the foundation it provides is very valuable and will definitely make you think more mathematically at programming problems. The difficulty of this course starts to increase after the midterm exam, and it does get pretty tough nearing the end. I recommend starting the assignments as early as possible and attend as many office hours if you have any questions. The course staff are very responsive and do offer a good amount of help depending on your questions. Overall, I can't say much about the in-person learning experience, but this course was suited well for online learning and I enjoyed it. ",
      "Not a bird course, although if you have background in programming it would not be difficult at all. Racket is somewhat useless but I learned some concepts that will be useful for other programming languages",
      "This course is taught in an archaic language that no one uses and no one understands. Instructors' explanations are irrelevant to actual questions and I got yelled during office hrs even though I stated that I need a little patience (I am disabled). Assignments and quizzes are unreasonably hard. I took to take this for bioinformatics option and decided to change my future career. Truly the worst in UW history. If you don't need this course, run.",
      "Nice course that teaches you how to write simple code. But little annoying that you have to do Design Recipe (especially writing an explanation for codes). There is no loop in DrRacket so being able to understand recursion is important. All course contents are based on a website and you have to read everything and code something on that website. Pity that this course will not show many algorithms or data structures. So far I think those who can just play computer games (i.e. no coding experience but can easily type using the keyboard)  can easily get 90+ in this course.  If you have ever coded like C, python, java, pascal and so on, easy to get 95+.  Idk why the easy rate goes so low but trust me, super easy course if you finish reading the material (okay reading part may be a little boring and CS 135 provide detailed intros which seem not wordy)",
      "Can be difficult at times, but a very rewarding and fun course. Definitely made me like CS as a non-CS student! Start assignments early and definitely go to office hours. TAs and ISAs are very helpful.",
      "The only way to do bad in this course is by not managing ur time properly. This is a mistake I made when we had to work with modules. As long as u properly manage ur time and do assignments and concept checks well before the due date, you will have a great time in this course. Also try finding connections between assignments and try finding some real world applications of racket. Trust me Racket is very useful. The only criticism I have of this course is how the course is taught because it wasn't taught. (this is when I did online.) I had to understand all concepts by myself by basically reading texts. Although There was plenty of opportunity like office hours to ask for help, I only realized that towards the end of the term. Very unfortunate :(",
      "math student who took this course since I had 0 prior programming experience. the course isn't horribly hard, but if you fall behind or don't understand one lesson, everything following will be super challenging. the course was mostly online completing modules, and my biggest criticism is that solutions for lessons are never posted after they are due which makes it super challenging to do the next week's module if you didn't understand/didnt know how to write a specific code for the week. the racket language used in this course is easy to follow but not very useful and isn't used anywhere. this makes it difficult to find help outside of cs115 profs/ta's/past cs115 students. the course is oddly paced, felt the super easy and simple first half of the course, and then gets unreasonably fast. didn't find any of the profs/ta's answers to questions posted on discussion boards useful at all. because the course was only offered online, I had to essentially had to teach the whole course to myself",
      "I really enjoyed this course online, being co-taught by 4 professors. There were lots of office hours available to help and all of the TA's and Profs in office hours were helpful and kind. While the programming language used is not useful elsewhere, I think it is easy to understand and helped get the point of the course across. In my opinion, the point of this course is to teach you to think about solving problems and the process to go through, as you are not creating ground-breaking programs. As a student with no prior programming experience, I found this course both useful and easy if you kept up with the content and got help as soon as you needed it. The course was organized well, and the built in questions made sure you were on the right track. The assignments are fair based on what you learn. Go in with an open mind and keep up with the content and you should be just fine. ",
      "I recommend finding a course with a language that is actually useful. Racket is dumb and never used anywhere. The majority of the course was quite easy, except a couple of concept checks that were RIDICULOUSLY HARD. i wish i had realized sooner that you get 10% of concept checks dropped from your grade. if you understand everything and are getting most things easily but you get stumped on one particular concept check, its probably not your fault and you should skip it, at least for now. the course was very well structured and predictable. expectations were clear and reasonable. it actually was designed to be a correspondence course, so it wasnt an online course that was rushed and slapped together for covid. ",
      "I loved everything about cs 115. Great instructors, fair assignments ( can get tricky but there's a huge amount of office hours to attend ), good engagement and interesting topics! It's seriously well structured and I would recommend it to anyone even with no background in coding. ",
      "Took this in 2018 with no programming experience ever. Started out pretty slow, but I didn't really pay attention and was severely behind. Went to a lot of office hours, but nonetheless caught up and did decently well.\n\nAfter taking more cs courses, racket really is a weird language.",
      "It starts with a very low pace but after midterm, it gets really fast and I cannot understand the content while reaching the end of term. Racket is restricted by so many things so I feel I lose the freedom of coding. The assignments are extremely hard after midterm, I spent a whole day on them but I can just solve the easiest one. The only positive impression that I have is that the design recipe weighs half so I pass this course successfully. ",
      "One of my least favourite courses. Although things were nicely organized, Racket was such an annoying language to use. The one tangible benefit I felt after using Racket was feeling more comfortable with recursion. ",
      "go to office hours and practice ",
      "I didn't have any programming experience prior to this and racket traumatized the f out of me",
      "Racket is one of the most unclear, inaccessible, and idiotic languages ever created. \nThis was supposed to be an introduction to computer science, so someone explain to me why they would choose such a remote language. It is difficult to code in, not intuitive, and because no credible institution (outside of a few universities) uses it, you can't find good resources online, so you can't teach yourself, or clarify concepts. \nI was also surprised how unresponsive the tutors are at UW. \nFurthermore, I got yelled at when I went to the cs help center. \nDo not take this course if you have little experience with coding and this is not a required course.",
      "I had 2-3 years of programming experience in Python/Java, and have managed to get a 97%. Haven't been to a lecture since the end of September. Everything is online. If you're like me and you hate programming, I recommend taking CS135, because the only thing I hate more than programming is programming useless things (essentially this entire course.)\n\nOr, if you want an easy gpa boost, take this course if you know programming.",

      "Terrible language ",
      "Wasif Khan was an okay professor, he probably would've been better if the class wasn't so shy... and if I had attended more lectures lol. The course comes with an online platform with very in-depth modules that explain the concept, provides coding concept checks, and interactive visuals (mainly for the sorting & tree modules).  So you don't have to attend the lectures if time is a priority. In the course we had 11 quizzes with the lowest mark being dropped (total 20% all together), easy; 9 assignments with the lowest mark being dropped (total 30% all together); a midterm (worth 10% ); and a finals (worth 40%). It taught A LOT about recursion, like half of it, but if you read read the modules and do the concept checks you should be fine (even if you were bad at it before like me). *Watch out for module 8 with abstract list functions. The assignment that was the hardest.* ALSO NOTE: You HAVE to get a 50% on both the course AND the final exam, so be careful with that. ",
      "It was... fine ig. I took this course because I wanted an easy bird, and it sure was easy. Stopped going to lectures in like the second week, did completely fine, one of my highest grades actually. All the notes are online so going to lectures is not very necessary. ISAs are super helpful if you go ask about assignments. Quizzes are super easy and open book/collaborative, do recommend going to the labs for the quizzes, talk with people around you, ask ISAs for any questions you don't know. Quiz labs are also a great opportunity to talk about/ask ISAs for help with the assignment due next week.",

You use Python in this course which is quite practically and I quite liked Python myself. The first three weeks or so are a continuation of Racket from CS 115 though. Afterwards you basically learn what you learned in CS 115 but in Python instead (there are just a couple of new concepts that weren't present in Racket, and you also learn runtime but that's not too bad).

Online term, makes it all the more difficult because the modules do not even cover 1/3rd of what is asked on the assignments. This course is designed to fail. ",

I had not taken Computer Science in my high school and thought that coming here can clear my concepts, but they didn't teach anything and made us learn everything by ourselves. I strongly recommend everyone don't take this course. ",
      "The online format is horrible. You essentially have to teach yourself the entire course. And it is a difficult course, definitely takes up the majority of your week, especially if you have a full course load. Office Hours are a scam because it seems like they're offered a lot but they are not helpful. The TAs/ISAs there will basically just say \"We can't give you any hints\". Don't take the course unless you need it! ",
      "I took the online. The content of this course wasn't much harder than CS115, but the amount of work they throw at you is absurd. At least 2 deadlines a week, and the assignments are very time consuming- easily taking 3 full days each to complete, while having an entire unit which can take a full day as well. About 80% of my time last term was spent on this course. However, this being said, the content is not too bad, but weeks 6-8 are the hardest content and where the course really starts to ramp up the difficulty. My biggest suggestion for anybody taking this course online is utilize office hours! Try to go to office hours with the profs because they know what they can and can't say regarding the assignments, whereas TAs will tell you really general and unhelpful information most of the time.

      "This course offers very interesting material and provides a basic foundation to python which I believe is a very useful skill. I am not a CS person so I won't lie, I found this course challenging more than I found it easy. The concept checks start off easy but then get a lot more complex due to all the string and list methods we use. The assignments are like they were in CS15 meaning they were three questions on average however they can definitely be time consuming given if you have not learned python before, or have even no experience in coding. This course isn't something you can just put aside for a bit and do the day before either, you may be able to get away with it at the start but come module 4 and up, it gets more challenging. My advice to succeeding in this course is to actually go out and buy a python textbook so you can get some extra reading in about the things you will be learning in the course, because for me I didn't always find the readings on EdX clear nor enough. As well, abuse office hours. Always go when you're stuck and definitely try assignments early because doing the design recipe for python takes a lot more time than in racket and is not something you want to be starting at 1 am, the morning its due. One main thing I liked however was that the course is a lot more organized/set up than CS115 was. ",
      "Python is a fun language. The assignments were easy but I wish they were a bit more practical for using python outside of the course. The modules were long but good for learning the content. ",
      "Good course for learning python. Design recipe sucks but besides that go through the modules carefully (especially past runtime efficiency) and ask questions, and you'll do great.",
      "One of the best courses I had taken in first-year. I would strongly advise studying cs115 thoroughly in order to score good grades in this course. Overall, JP Pretti was a great professor and a great mentor. ",
      "Way better than CS 115, probably because of prof Carmen Bruni, the most useful prof in CS 116. The organization of content is very good and helps a lot to understand everything about basic python. Assignments are doable, the final is not hard, as long as you spend some time on it, you will succeed. ",
      "This course was an excellent successor to CS 115. The first part of the course was mainly review of concepts, using Python as the language. Halfway through things did get a little bit more difficult, but still manageable. The online modules had a lot of concept checks, which helped to learn, but also took quite a while. The assignments were fair, if you start early and go to office hours when you are stuck you shouldn't have a problem. 50% final on paper is hard to prepare for, but felt like a fair exam. ",
      "Interesting course and fair mark.",
      "Very simple introduction to Python, I took the online version which had a final project instead of a Final exam.",
      "Useful introduction course to python and imperative language. Since they can ask you to design more complex functions using python, you might be having difficulty figuring out the algorithms at first. Once you are familiar with what you can do with imperative language, you would feel very comfortable writing codes in this course. Keep in mind that the online version sometimes have an in-person final exam worth 50% of your final grade and you MUST pass the final to pass this course. It is not necessarily a final project for the online version.",
      "6",
      "Fantastic course. Assignments were doable and assessments were fair. We used edX which was not a great platform but this is made up for by the fact that lectures actually taught content (unlike a certain other first year CS course)",
      "The tutorials were very helpful for understanding course concepts and getting help on assignments. The ISAs this term were not a flop. ",
      "Really interesting course. I enjoyed learning Python. I had minimal experience before (literally spent one week doing Codecademy in the summer) and that tiny amount of prior knowledge really helped me a lot during the course.",
      "Pretty easy course that reinforces concepts taught in 115 and 135 such as recursion and efficiency. The final exam was straightforward and there isn't any content that is extremely difficult, however the course does take a lot of time each week. Felt it was much more about the workload with all the quizzes and modules than actually difficult content.",
      "Super chill, spent a couple of hours on it a week and got a really good mark. Never went to lectures."

      "Really cool course, especially for beginner CS course.",
      "Fantastic foundation for computer science. Scheme was used as the teaching language, which I found to be a good choice. It allows for easy understanding of recursion, data structures, and other basic concepts, as it is a functional language (vs. an iterative language like C, Python, or Java). The material is easy to grasp depending on the student's ability to interpret and express abstract ideas. Tutorials are recommended regardless of how well you are doing in the course, as it consolidates the week's information in a quick and easy manner.",
      "May be a little daunting at first coming from high school, but stick through it and you'll be fine.",
      "Functional programming is poopy. That is all I can say about Scheme as both a language and a concept. (Sorry, it's called \"Racket\" now, but when I used it, it was called \"Scheme\")\n\nIt's useful if you care about this kind of thinking, but I can guarantee you that no major tech industry uses this kind of thinking thus far (Q3 2013).",
      "easiest CS course. i missed it",
      "Good for recursion",
      "The courseload was heavy and I had a prof that was hard to understand but I liked the material covered. I had never programmed before.",
      "Really taught us how to think in terms of programming!",
      "Good intro to functional programming. If you're coming in with a background in imperative programming (C, Java), forget you ever knew it while you're working in Scheme (DrRacket). It'll make things easier.",
      "This class was interesting to learn about Scheme, and lambda functions are amazing!",
      "Easy and basic course, but you will learn scheme ",
      "I found the class difficult, coming from having no programming background. It definitely gives you a good foundation for CS though. If you're planning to take more advanced programming classes, this class and 136 are probably good to have, even if you're non-major.",
      "Relatively easy material. Very basic computing.",
      "As a math student I regret not taking 115. This class was good as a programming class but I wish I could've had the time I spent on it for my math classes.",
      "Fantastic course - teaches you good problem solving skills, very well laid out course",
      "Uses the functional language scheme, very interesting to use",
      "Definitely do all of the tutorial practice problems to practice your LISP :)",
      "A very useful and informative introductory course. Some assignments have time-consuming questions but if you attend class and review the notes (which are very helpful) it is not bad.",
      "Dont dislike this course just because it uses Scheme. ",
      "Make sure you do all assignments on your own and understand all the concepts in this course..",
      "We learned some basics about computer science. It covered some material regarding recursion, trees, graphs, and functional programming. The language we used \u2013 Scheme/Racket \u2013 was not that useful. I would've much preferred using a much more practical language. The tutorials were not very helpful for me.",

      "Need to put in time for this course! Do not procrastinate.",
      "The assignments can become more difficult later in the course.  The material is certainly relevant however. It's true what they say, most of the time doing assignments is spent thinking about the design of your code rather than writing it out.",
      "This course is pretty easy, especially if you have prior programming experience. If you've never programmed before you might not have the right mindset for the problems but that should come easily enough. The assignments aren't bad and it covers some interesting topics.",
      "Start the assignments as early as possible!",

      "Pretty straightforward course - admittedly gets a bit convoluted in the last couple of modules if you've never seen the content before, but a good mark is pretty easy to get if you keep up with the assignments and go to lectures. Midterm was deceptively difficult, and final was very long but otherwise fair.",
      "A pretty easy introductory course.",

      "Basic knowledge. Not hard if you attend classes.",
      "Very Interesting/Useful/Fun Course. It is difficult for first years mainly because of the new learning style and course load, I actually failed it my first time and took it again, but I got 80+ the second time and I found it much more interesting. ",
      "  A very easy course, however not much of the contents are useful compare to other CS courses.",
      "Assignments ramp up in difficulty like crazy after the midterm(s), but the course is useful. Can be pretty fast paced and easy to brush off until you realize too late that you're falling behind.",
      "Super easy course, if you fail this you probably shouldn't be in CS ",
      "Racket. Don't hate on it. Yes, what you learn doesn't seem directly applicable, but it really helps with understanding other concepts, and as you will find out, is actually very applicable. You will do more recursion in this course than you've ever done before.",

      "Like CS 136, success in this course is based entirely on practice and finishing the assignments. Start assignments early! Like the day it comes out, by A7 or when recursion hits, people start having a hard time. Read ahead of the notes and practice practice practice! People come into the course thinking that it'll be a breeze because they've been programming for years. But this is functional programming. It's very likely they've never touched this kind of stuff before. But if you practice all the time and consider all the test cases when designing your functions, you'll be fine! good luck!",
      "A good course to introduce the concepts of computer science",

      "A very interesting course to introduce students into Computer Science. Using a functional languages like Racket makes most people with high-school computer science knowledge interested in the course, since it covers very familiar concepts in a completely different paradigm. Aside from the interesting aspects of functional programming, anyone with previous background in Computer Science may find parts of this course fairly boring, but there is something to be said about the elegance of functional languages, and the way it easily implements concepts like recursion. ",
      "Good intro course into CS.  Even if you did cs in high school, you still may be challenged a little.  Definitely a well structured course.  The final was quite difficult though.",
      "Easy course. 80% of it is just applying one recursive pattern over and over again. The final exam can be a bit long though, so be prepared to write as quickly as you can from the start.",
      "This course is certainly interesting as it uses a language you probably have never seen before. Nevertheless, it still teaches you a lot of the fundamental CS concepts and it was pretty good overall.",
      "Functional programming is slightly different from other programming you might have done in high school, which can throw off people.",
      "Most of the material taught in this course, you will never use again. However, it is good to know it exists. You are going to want to really understand lambda calculus and recursion, as these concepts will come back to haunt you all the time in CS, even if you never use a functional language again.\n\nWords of warning: The final exam was highly skewed towards the last two weeks. Study those lambda functions!",
      "The course teaches problem solving and introduces you to the thinking of a computer scientist. It's also great for teaching the importance of clear, documented code. However, this is a rarely used language, and as someone who hadn't programmed before, I found the course too fast-paced for me.",
      "I really appreciate that we start learning CS functionally. It helped me understand the beauty of recursion and made using recursion far more natural in future courses. Racket was also very beautiful in syntax - it uses very simple and consistent syntax. ",
      "An easy course.",
      "Not a fan of Racket, but don't blame Racket if you do bad. I ended up with 74%, which for a CS major is not really good and I blamed Racket. Racket is possibly one of the best languages for learning recursion so enjoy this course. Extremely useful course, but was difficult for me.",
      "Do the assignments and it's a breeze.",
      "As someone who had no programming knowledge previously, I was a bit apprehensive for this course. But I found it to be very manageable, as long as you go to lectures and do the assignments. The assignments start off quite straightforward and simple, but be careful towards the end- they get quite complex. Don't be that guy who starts things the day before it's due for this course. ",
      "Good intro to big CS topics, I can see how the pacing might be fast for people who never done programming before however.",
      "Easy class, functional programming might not be very useful but its a good way to get you thinking",
      "It's a course that you don't realize is going to be fun. Just listen to your prof carefully and just somehow pass through the first half of the course. It gets nicer after that",
      "Assignments are mostly easy, but make sure you go to office hours if you're stuck.  Final exam was easier than the midterms.",
      "Picks up after assignment 6. Really gotta focus and do assignments early. Final was easier than midterms.",
      "Starts pretty slow and definitely gets bogged down by the design recipe (ow). Otherwise you'll see some decent fundamental functional programming concepts, and you'll get good at recursion (assuming you do the assignments).",
      "Perfectly balanced course. Assignments were always the perfect difficulty. They were a lot of work but attainable and once you finish them you for sure will know the material 100%. Compared to Math 135 assignments, which I often needed help to solve, you can actually do these assignments if you spend the time. TA's and great and seem to care a lot. Course slides is were you learn everything, rarely used or referenced the textbook. I came into this course with minimal coding knowledge (very basic Java and Python) and has no issues.",
      "Good introduction for those who know nothing. Made recursion feel easy and natural. Functional programming is pretty cool but not explored in depth enough for me personally. If you have any previous experience this course should be quite easy overall, but if you have none it can get challenging, particularly in the middle with the pace picks up all of a sudden.",
      "If you're scared about going in with no previous experience, don't worry! The design allows people who have never coded, like me, to learn and be confident that they know what they are learning. Start assignments on time and don't half-ass them! It's ok to get 50 on a couple, but it adds up! The assignments are where you're actually gonna understand the material but lectures are important for providing you with a basic understanding. When it comes to exams, the best thing to do is practice!",
      "Racket really forces/helps you learn recursion + functional programming. You'll appreciate this course later.",
      "Really fun course, especially if you've never programmed in a functional language before. Really gets cool when you get to things like different forms of recursion, trees, maps and filters. Still accessible if you don't have much experience programming, but will definitely make you a better programmer if you do have prior experience otherwise. ",
      "Good introduction course to fundamentals of computer science. ",
      "It was a difficult course for me and I struggled with finishing the assignments. But I definitely learned a lot. It's definitely NOT an easy course and be prepared to put in the effort if you do not have prior coding skills like me.",
      "The class covers basic coding well so advancing to a harder code does not shock as much. The course is challenging (3-7 hours to do the weekly assignments) but there are a lot of profs and TAs that are willing to help in their office hours.",
      "As someone who has never programmed before it was a course that I was able to excel in.  ",
      "Fairly easy course that doesn't demand any previous programming knowledge. Mostly focuses on doing things to lists in Racket, with an emphasis on different types of recursion. Weekly assignments and two midterms, but fairly easy to do well in if you put in the effort. Not too much content.",
      "This course is the first cs course for CS major students. Not a very hard course but assignments take you very long time.",
      "It\u2019s a course you have to just get through. It does teach some important concepts, but the fact that after a whole course I can\u2019t say I learned anything to help me get a job kinda made the whole experience worthless. ",
      "Pretty easy until you get to the 2nd midterm. Final was really hard. Still liking Racket more than C though. Recursion is OP.",
      "Was taught fall 2019 in Byron's class. Not the best prof, struggles to keep the class engaged and made a LOT of mistakes in the lectures. As an almost beginner to cs, this course was extremely hard and the midterm and final were also very hard though it seemed the final got curved at the end. Useless course in racket imo, cs 136 felt much better and easier. ",
      "If you've taken any CS course before this, it won't be too difficult to pick up the basics but the language (Racket) is still different enough that you'll learn a lot. The last few assignments got exponentially difficult and time-consuming. ",
      "Pretty easy if you took the ICS courses in high school.",
      "Pretty light course, easy to get a mark in the 90s",
      "The instructors made a fabulous job of putting together the online course. If you put in the time, you can get a great mark. Just pay attention to the design recipe!",
      "I'm a CS guy. This course was Racket, a functional programming language like Lisp, Scheme or Haskell. You learn a lot of things you'd other wise never learn from coding in functional languages (i.e. C/C++/C#, Java, Python, Bash, HTML/CSS/JS). It's really a whole new paradigm. The design recipe is stupid, and I fail to see how it helps. I'd prefer a more flexible documentation style where you don't get marks docked for writing `bool` instead of `Bool`. That said, because of all the bonus, it's quite easy to get a good mark. I'm currently sitting at 100.5%, just after A07 (3 more assignments and the Final to go). Make sure you be very very careful in this course and notice every little detail. I got 5% off Midterm1 because I didn't see a line in the question.",
      "You will never use Racket in the real world and DrRacket sucks. So does the design recipe, and the entire course. Very easy to get a high mark if you're willing to put the effort, if you're not and you have experience a mark 80-90 is manageable ",
      "Took online this term, and it was very well run. Only weekly assignments, which were a challenge and took a while but were for the most part doable. The midterms were also very straightforward which was nice for a change. Super organized course, office hours was very helpful and welcoming. All in all probably my favourite course this term.",
      "We used Racket, which is one of the worst programming languages I've ever seen, and is practically useless. In addition, 30% of our grade was documentation. \n\nThat being said, the course was really well set up, and while I didn't learn a lot, it was pretty fun. We had one assignment a week which took about 3 hours (also a handful of bonus marks). I recommend this course to anyone in the faculty of math. To anyone else, find a course that teaches a real programming language.",
      "CS 135 was all I could ask for in an intro programming class and more! Learning a functional programming language like Racket was super interesting, and got me to appreciate concepts like recursion a lot more. Taking it online (fall 2020), it was the most well-handled class I was in, and I felt like I genuinely learned something. The assignments were tough but doable, and in comparison to high school cs assignments, these ones taught me way more about the concepts at hand in cool ways.",
      "Pretty easy course if you took cs in highschool. For the online version, don't do assignments last minute since they do take a while, and the last couple assignments get pretty tough. Midterms are pretty easy, and the learning materials were excellently put together by the staff. ",
      "Keep in mind, I took this course in the online term, so things may be dramatically different in a regular term.\n\nFor those who have experience coding before, or find mathematics more intuitive than English, you probably won't have a hard time with this course. However, that person is NOT me, so while the first four assignments were relatively okay, most of A05-A09 was difficult for me. This course is particularly dense with material for those new to computer science, so I would recommend studying earlier rather than later. Do NOT procrastinate on the assignments, or else you may be spending Monday night struggling to meet the deadline. If you do the assignments and get high marks on them, you should be relatively okay for the midterms.\n\nThat being said, the professors this online term were really nice and accommodating. They consistently asked for feedback, were responsive on Piazza, and even gave words of encouragement from time to time. Although I do not know whether what I learned is immediately applicable to other courses, I do feel I gained a better sense of how to approach problems from a systematic perspective. \n\nShould you take this course if you're not in the Math faculty? If you're considering going into tech or interested in learning how to code, it's worth a try, even if you have to drop down to CS 115 later on. If you're just looking to fulfill a requirement in your program, I would suggest a different course.",
      "Not hard, just requires mathematical thinking",
      "Best online course you could take, questions are not too bad if you've done any programming before, but still approachable if you are brand new to coding",
      "CS 135, despite the COVID-19 pandemic, was run fantastically over the fall 2020 term. Honestly, I had to take this course again, if it was offered in-person, I would take this course online again because it was that well run. The instructors really did a phenomenal job running this course despite all the obstacles with online learning!",
      "Although racket may seem useless, teaching this for a first-year course really allows us to learn to design function programs, which is the name of the course. I have personally applied the concepts to other languages like python and java so it definitely helps. ",
      "Really well designed course. Be warned that it get's a little harder towards the end and that the assignments are very time consuming.",
      "Racket isn't really a useful language, but learning recursion with it was a lot easier than I thought. The course was also really well delivered online with the profs making lots of lecture videos that were a big help. Peep the cs135 memes on reddit lmao",
      "Honestly, I really enjoyed the course. I thought the topic was useful and the assignments were actually a blast to do. People underestimate the design recipes too much imo, I found myself missing them while doing other courses.",
      "No lectures, only a few videos in slides from previous years. They clearly put no effort into giving us quality online learning in 2020...except office hours which were helpful. Objectively, the evaluations were fair, and self-check questions were free marks because of the way they were calculated, but I think I just hated this course and its assignments with a personal passion. Otherwise I might've liked it as many people have.",
      "Does what it says. Teaches you how to write functional programs. It was fun. The lectures had some high-quality videos. The best course of my first semester. Could use more videos in lectures.",
      "Enjoyed the course. Even though it's not going to be applicable in the future, I feel like functional programming teaches you how to think about problems in a different way which was something I enjoyed learning :) In the online section, your prof does not matter at all. All learning is basically done by reading lecture slides. ",
      "Taken Online:\nThis was my first real introduction to a programming class as my high school classes were basically a joke. Functional programming can be very cool, being forced to understand what's going on under the hood by using Racket will definitely make anyone who takes it a better programmer. Once you get the hang of Racket and are able to adjust your mind this class becomes very passable due to the grading structure. What I didn't like was the multipart questions where you get to h) and you don't even know what the questions asking. The profs did a great job transferring it to online, was my favorite class of 1A, shoutout Becker.",
      "Not too sure about the usefulness of Racket, but it was an enjoyable course. I would still say I had more fun with High School Computer Science though",
      "Decent course overall.\n\nSome assignments were very easy, some assignments were brutally difficult(watch out for A09). My issue lied with the delivery of the content:   unlike other faculties and universities, the Math Faculty chose to have no live lectures this term. Because of this, I found myself a bit confused, however I was able to find Lesley Istead's recorded lectures on YouTube.  However, the office hours were all class. Try to attend Paul Nijjar's office hours, he helps you understand a concept without making you feel bad, if that makes any sense. Inflated marks during the pandemic, the course median ended up being a 92!, which I've heard is insane for a university class.",
      "Course was pretty easy though be extremely careful with the design recipe as missing constants or other seemingly small details can lead to large mark deductions.",
      "Awesome course! Teaches you from scratch and everything is explained nicely. ",
      "Take the online version of this course. Since I am not a new programmer, I do not see any content that is hard to understand, as long as you take your time and watch the videos carefully. Though Racket is not a popular language, it is interesting to learn about functional programming, which differs from Java and C. Assignments are much harder than assessments but are still doable, which takes 5-6 hours for each one. Start it early and ask questions frequently on Piazza. Hope that all the other CS courses can be organized like this.",
      "Definitely solidifies recursion intuition!",
      "Assignments and midterms / final were all pretty easy. Byron Weber Becker was teaching and he's a great prof, made the class very fun to take",
      "Great course, fun assignments, awesome profs. Functional programming is also super cool.",
      "This was a great course. A great introduction to programming with a functional programming language. Assignments were sometimes hard, but doable, and they were also fun to do. I would say watch out for the transition to CS 136.",
      "Took this in F2020 and it was my most favorite class of the term as well as one of my most favorite class in UW so far. The course was well-organized, the weekly module was structured in a way that really helped me solidify my knowledge through a combination of slides reading, video lecture, self-check exercises in the form of quiz and coding. Learning recursion was super helpful, especially when encountering naturally recursive data such as linked lists or trees in future classes and in the industry. Overall a 10/10 class.",
      "Absolute fire course. The middle of the course is tough but push through it!",
      "This response is written after taking second year courses. Although Racket itself is not as useful as many other programming languages encountered in later courses. Racket's logic is very simple and can help you solve many math questions fast, even the ones where it cannot be handled by a calculator. This course is a good introduction to programming and it is one of the easiest programming courses out there. ",
      "The course was taught in Racket so you'll have to get used to how it works. I actually grew to like it a lot by the end of the term. We covered a lot of interesting topics like recursion, trees, and graphs. Difficulty ranged from really easy to really hard. Make sure to start the assignments at least 3 days before they're due or you're screwed! This class was super fun and the modules were great. Whoever the prof was that made the videos was awesome.",
      "good for recursion intuition",
      "Racket takes a while to get used to, but eventually it stops feeling weird to code with. Weekly assignments were straightforward, some were a bit more tricky, but if you stare at them long enough, it will just click eventually. ",
      "Racket and functional programming aren\u2019t fun, especially if you have previous coding experience, but the concepts we covered were interesting and seems useful. Start the assignments early.",
      "Some assignments take time but a 90+ is really feasible. Still wish it wasn't racket though, we would all benefit from an oopl instead of racket.",
      "Pretty good introduction to university-level CS. The concepts weren't too hard, but I took this in Fall 2021 online so the slides were tedious to go through, and the assignments were also long and tedious. The exams were very fair, though.",
      "Was very well executed online! You gain a  deeper understanding of how to approach coding problems.",
      "Really good course taught by an excellent prof. It teaches the basics of functional programming; and it's done in Racket, which is different and adds a bit of a challenge. ",
      "Overall a useful course as it is a good introduction to functional programming, which I had never explored in-depth before.  However, as someone with prior programming experience I found it extremely easy and rather slow-moving.  If you have developed reasonable-sized programs or done any competitive programming, take CS 145 instead -- it seems to be far more interesting.  The only big annoyance in the course was the extremely strict style guide marking -- I lost points on nearly every assignment for slight formatting errors or for missing one test case.  Admittedly learning how to follow a style guide is necessary, but some of the tiny things they go after seem a bit extreme.",
      "Really interesting introduction to Functional programming, lots of useful concepts covered even if Racket itself is not useful at all. As a non-math student the course was managable, but make sure you start the assignments early. FInal was hard but the midterm was easier. Overall I'd recommend this course if you are interested in CS, but be ready to put in the effort.",
      "Great intro to CS",
      "This course was my first taste of programming, ever so take my review with a grain of salt- I thought it was very well done and clearly organized for the Fall 2020 term (online). Recursion was very interesting, and I actually used Racket for CS 241 so I am very grateful for what I learned in this course",
      "A great intro to CS which helps you build an understanding of several CS concepts, all in a way that is quite different then you must've initially learnt through OOP. The language is somewhat annoying but you'll really come to enjoy how well this course organised things and how user friendly the software was when you take future courses. It helps build a strong knowledge of recursion and other fundamental CS concepts. Profs and office hours were also very helpful.",
      "Extremely fun course, introduces you to the paradigm of functional programming using Racket as its medium. Each assignment had fun algorithmic style problems. Midterm and Final were pretty easy (But I took this in COVID so....)",
      "racket, the language for this course is kinda annoying to deal with and the design reports on every single function is pretty annoying, but overall, the course was really useful for learning about and wrapping your head around recursion. i had the course online",
      "Took it online and there are wayyy too less videos. Basically reading hard topics and trust me its not useful. Assignments are really interesting but hard, don't sit on them. The midterms were a breeze. Definitely possible to get 90+ if you just complete everything properly.",
      "Good course",
      "Lots of useful theory. People hate racket but it is a simple language that can be used to learn new stuff fairly well. Assignments are very annoying.",
      "leetcode in racket be like",
      "Fun and easy course that teaches the basics of programming",
      "this course bangs. love fp",
      "First half of the course was pretty chill, and then the weekly assignments got gradually more time-consuming after the second midterm. Lectures tend to be very straightforward and clear. It is a very well-structured course. Racket is not as bad as some other described to be, it is great for teaching the contents of this course, which is to design programs methodically. Requires grave commitment if you are new to programming.",
      "If you know to program well, but still struggle with the concept of binary trees and trees in general, I recommend taking this course",
      "Assignments kicked my ass but everyone handled things a bit differently. Had some previous Python programming experience but that didn't really translate to understanding Racket and the logic required for 135 at all. Sounds obvious but it's really important to thoroughly understand what was covered in lectures to actually be able to do the assignments.",
      "First portion of the course was pretty easy. Then they dropped the trees assignment... which for real hit diff. Otherwise, higher-order functions, lambda, locals, etc were actually pretty straightforward. Assignments weren't that painful (except the trees). Make use of office hours to check your work or if you are stuck. Get to really understand recursion and you'll probably do fine.",
      "Racket is a fun little language if you don't care too much about CS, but it would be nice to learn something real-world applicable as well.",
      "https://pastebin.com/F4FdfZGQ",
      "Even coming from a background of programming knowledge I honestly really enjoyed CS 135 and the new perspectives it gave me. First of all: both before and after the course you'll hear a lot of people complaining about Racket, insisting that UW should be using a \"practical language\", and maybe even about how useless the course is. I would disregard this until you've completed the course and come to your own conclusions. For anyone who has mostly been using imperative languages, the idea of a functional programming language will likely seem very foreign and is actually a great learning opportunity. Doing basic imperative tasks in a functional language will allow you to start from scratch and really understand what you're doing and how you're doing it. The last 25% of the course introduces a lot of topics that you may be unfamiliar with, but if you've been following along, you'll end up understanding their implementations very thoroughly and on a more conceptual level. I'm almost a little sad we're dropping Racket next term... but that's just my view. Anyway, even if you think Racket isn't that useful in the real world (which, well, it isn't), give this course a serious chance and I think you'll have a much stronger foundation for future courses.",
      "I had almost no programming experience prior to this course. The content at the start of the course was deceivingly easy, but I really had difficulties with later assignments. Assignments took me around 10 hours to complete, if I could complete them. If you're in my position (with no prior experience), you might struggle a bit but it'll be manageable if you take the course seriously. ",
      "Racket seems stupid at first but I understood the benefits of functional programming towards the end.",
      "I LOVE RACKET!!!\n\nThis course was not my introduction to programming, but I liked the way it introduced topics like recursion and abstraction in a language where these things seem very natural. \nMost of the assignments were fun and had elegant solutions that made you appreciate racket and functional programming. Some of the later assignment problems, however, seemed to have much easier solutions in normal languages and were somewhat tedious in racket.\nEven though you will never use racket in the real world, I do think you will remember the concepts you learned here, which have uses far beyond this course.\n\nI hate design recipe though. It is useless after the first two assignments and a boring way to lose marks on assignments.",
      "I think the course is a good intro to CS. You learn recursion really well, the assignments were challenging starting from A7 but it really pushes you to approach problems from different perspectives. Taking the course with Troy was a blast, he is super fun and engaging. The worse part about the course was the midterms and final that are super long and you had to write code on paper which is annoying. My best tips are to start the assignments early and most importantly, to try to understand what your code does instead of just running it and hoping for the best, I wish I did that earlier in the course because it made a big difference. ",
      "Racket is pretty cool. ",
      "If you have any CS background (i.e. doing decently well on the CCC), you will have no difficulty in the course. You will have to relearn the fundamentals of computer science and you will have to focus more on good programming practices than computer science itself. This course sorta makes you become a better programmer as you're required to do design recipes and make your code \"readable\", as well as include testing, but only covers the mere surface of computer science with things like BSTs, graphs, simple big O notation, etc. Also Racket. Very interesting programming language (it's all functional programing, as opposed to imperative programming) where you don't have variables, so you have to learn and be intuitive in Racket.",
      "Assignments take a lot of time but if you are careful, you should be able to get close to full marks. Midterms just require practise and are doable. Course teaches on some basic/fundamental CS concepts, especially with recursion, which you'll do a lot in this course.",
      "Racket was an absolute pain at the start, but you begin to enjoy it. Very well-organized course to the point where I didn't need to go to lectures. Make sure to start on assignments early, or you will probably never do it (speaking from experience). Pretty fair course structure. ",
      "Lots of work but the work itself is not that difficult. Fun course, enjoyed Professor Weber Becker ",
      "Try not to lose marks on design recipe. Content starting from trees becomes really hard.",
      "The goal of this course is to be an intro into computer science and to teach good programing habits. The language you use is Racket which is quite different from many languages that people are familiar with. It can be a bit tedious and restricting but, I ended up finding it really interesting. Assignments can often be time consuming (of course) but getting a good grade on them wasn't too hard. Overall I quite liked this course and thought it did a good job achieving it's purposes. ",
      "One of the assignments is quite difficult, but others are fine. I'd say if you put some effort in this course, you will get high marks (90s).",
      "Good for improving critical thinking in programming if you are a beginner.\nThe course goes from walking baby steps to running 100m in Olympics after they introduce recursion.",
      "Took this as someone whos never taken a cs class before and it went alright (score in the 80s). Definitely the hardest of the 3 math classes in 1A. Assignments can take long",
      "Until generative recursion, everything was sailing smoothly. When general trees and graphs came in, the course felt a lot harder and I had to really spend time learning the concepts 2 to 3 times and making sure I understood them well. The final was hard :(",
      "It was so difficult but I genuinely learned a lot. I had zero experience going into the course, so I struggled to keep up, but it was rewarding. Perhaps its because I had no coding experience, but I actually found Racket to be interesting and worthwhile to learn. I'm now learning Python on my own and have found it to be much easier to understand than Racket was becuase I learned the fundamentals of coding. The skills I learned also help me with solving algebra and calculus questions as it taught me how to think step by step. ",
      "Very like this course and choose David Tompkins if you can",
      "Just do the assignments and read the course slides, it's majorly practice.",
      "Some assignments do take time and effort, but overall not too hard",
      "Racket seems pretty lame at the beginning, just give it like a month or two and ur gonna be fine with it.",
      "Racket is pretty useless, id recommend doing cs50 instead but make sure you utilize the office hours well, assignments wont feel as hard if you do.\nAnd if you can, get Dave Tompkins as your prof",
      "If you have ever done programming, the assignments will be relatively easy, although they do take time. Shit got serious after trees, so expect a grade drop",
      "intro stuff",
      "Big time requirement if you haven't coded before, and Racket is painful at times.",
      "Things might seems to be moving quite fast for totally beginner, but if you have some experience in coding then the course is not hard",
      "PLEASE TAKE CS 115 if you are a math student. I have experience with C, Java and Python, and learning Racket was a pure pain in the ass. Assignments will get harder radically after midterm and then you won't be able to downgrade to CS 115, which means retaking CS becomes necessary.",
      "Pretty easy course, I enjoyed learning about functional programming becasuse I never really did it before. You will definetly become good with recursion by the end of this.",
      "WTF IS THIS COURSE ?!?!?! Completely destroyed my OOP mindset, which is okay, but it's not even useful in the industry so adds nothing to my resume when I need to search for a co-op after my 1A term.",
      "Good time, great time. No prior CS knowledge is required, but this course definitely favours those who have experience thinking through problems. Design recipe can be annoying to do, in my experience, just reserve an hour a week, throw on some music, and work through it all at once.",
      "Challenging course if you come from 0 programming experience (as myself). Assignments are creatively made and course staff are helpful. First half of the course is still okay but second half gets pretty challenging.",
      "The focal point of the course is purely based on recursion but is taught in an arbitrary language called Racket that no one uses ever. Plenty of other ways to teach the concepts taught in this course such as trees and lists, by using an entry-level language that could help with co-ops for those who have never touched a language before. A mark booster of a course but I'd suggest taking CS115 if you want to try out programming since you'll have to waste less time on assignments and design recipes but still get the basic fundamentals of what they're teaching you.",
      "Pre midterm contents are pretty easy and manageable, and the post midterm contents got really difficult really quick with mutual recursion, trees and graphs. My advice - start working on the assignments as early as you can, at least 4 days before the deadline. Go to professor and TA office hours and enjoy!!",
      "Really easy course if you know some programming. Assignments take ~1-3 hours per week, midterm and final slightly different from assignments, though easy as well. If you know another programming language and basic concepts, go for CS145 and don't waste time.",
      "Very interesting class, and very easy to follow if you have prior programming experience. Mid terms were not too difficult if you do your weekly assignments",
      "An enjoyable first-year CS course! Starts from the complete fundamentals and gains a considerable amount of depth, with discussion of plenty of data structures and algorithms. Assignments took me roughly 4 hours each, and it wasn't a huge time commitment but the actual content did take some time to understand. It does get quite a bit more complex after the midterm, but not necessarily more difficult."

I found the efficiency portion of the course especially fun. Assignments take a while to reason through, especially in the latter third of the course, so be sure to start them early each week. Exams are fair - the midterm can be a bit rough, but the final, at least in our offering, followed almost exactly from assignments so it was very easy and boosted everyone's mark.",

The final ended up being extremely easy, so having a great average going into it makes for an easy 90.\n\nContent wise - take this course seriously! Pointers can be a bit hard to swallow at first if you're new to them. Really enjoyed the last bit of the course on linked lists and binary search trees - a lot easier to work with in C compared to Python.",

      "Course is not structured the best personally. Assignment content may have good intention, but no direction. The problem statements aren't very clear so you need to ask for clarification. Useful overall, but I feel the marking is absolutely stupid. You won't lose points on exams because you can't do algorithms, but because you forgot to include <stdio.h> or include const or forget a semi-colon. I got penalized because I forgot to write int once (2 points). The final was easy, but they marked it harshly so I didn't end up with what I expected.

      "The content itself is okay and is not difficult. The assignments in my perspective were not too tough, but the final exam this term was not straightforward enough. Generally speaking, the difficulty of the questions were about the same as that in the assignment questions (which are not hard but need plenty of time to think which can make you run out of time easily).  The grading was also tough -you can get a lot of unnecessary marks deducted for missing little detail. As a comparison, I had 95% on assignments but only ~60% on the exams. The handmarking questions on the assignments also had a really low average too.",

Also, get good at reading complex C declarations using the right-left rule because they will throw some seemingly-random gibberish like \nchar (*(*x())[5])(); at you.  Midterm and final were more \"long\" than \"difficult.\" at least when I took it so make sure know your stuff well enough to just write write write without stopping to second-guess yourself. The algorithms and data structures taught in second half of course are super useful and universal. ",

Up to assignment 5, most of the assignments were fair, but from assignment 5 onwards the assignments took a very long time, about 15-20 hours per assignment every week. However, you do learn a lot of fundamental cs concepts with C. Seashell still sucks at times.",
      "i'll never forgetting pulling a 60 on an assignment because I missed a single free and seashell didn't detect it :/",
      "This course took forever. Nearly every assignment took 10+ hours to complete, and I know this was a commonality amongst students as office hours regularly had three hour wait times, with most people not ever getting help. You do learn a lot in this course, but I don't think I learned any more than I would have if the assignments were much shorter and straightforward. ",
      "Gosh this one was a big step from cs135. The assignments were very challenging esp for a complete beginner with only cs135 programming knowledge. I wished I had taken cs116 before even though it would have made me a bit late on schedule. I had a 89% average on cs135 and thought I would do fine in cs136 but god I was wrong.\nHad a mental breakdown with this course since I understood the theory, understood what was asked to do for the assignments but simply didn't understand how to implement these things into my program. I found that during the first half of the course, there were not enough examples on how to use some functions in your program but it became much better in the second half of the course (even though the content became much more difficult) I failed 4 of the assignments but managed to get a 54% average on all assignments. The final exam took me nearly 15 hours to code but I managed to do every question.\n\nMy advice for this course is to go to office hours, esp 1-1 if you're like me and are afraid to ask questions in front of others. These office hours were soo helpful to understand the concepts and the TAs ISAs and Instructors really try to help you debug your code, understand what exactly the question requires from you and can explain the concepts in a different way to help you understand. I finally liked the course in the end even if it was a nightmare at the beginning.",
      "One of the most well-structured online courses I have been a part of. The course notes and the accompanying voiceover videos for each topic are so well designed that concepts such as linked lists and binary trees (whose implementation I found rather confusing before) came quite naturally to me. \n\nAssignments are the best thing about this course. They're actually fun, and you produce tangible results most of the time. I've found myself writing modules for assignment question which I can use on my personal projects as well. Assignments do hog up a lot of time, so make sure to start them early!\n\nCourse staff is amazing. Dismissing the useless Piazza dramas that occurred once or twice during the term, the marking for this course was fair and the exam difficulty was apt. Office hours held every weekday for at-least 2 hours so you won't have to struggle finding guidance in time. \n\nOverall 10/10 course, best course I have taken in first year.",
      "This was a very useful course. Knowing how pointers and dynamic memory works are super useful in the workplace and this course did an amazing job at teaching them.\n\nThe assignments were fair in my opinion. Yes some of them were challenging but every cs course you will take will have some challenging problems and if you start early enough you will have time to solve them and feel that rewarding feeling. \n\nOne thing that I did not love was the quizzes as part of the midterm and final, they were fair but I would prefer them to be strictly coding.\n\nOver all a super useful course and if you manage your time well, you can do really well, I ended off with a 96+.",
      "Super easy and straightforward course. The assignment questions can get hard, but you have a lot of time to work on them. The midterm and final were really fair. The Piazza experience was great too. Nothing bad to say about this course tbh. ",
      "Very useful course for intro to algos and data structures; relevant to Leetcode and interviews. Dealing with low level dynamic memory using malloc was interesting but painful to debug. Assignment 10 was a killer; 59 class median or something. Make sure you fully understand pointers and ASSERT ALL REQUIREMENTS!",
      "I enjoyed doing most of the assignments in this course, and I think C is a lot better/useful than Racket.",
      "Not as easy as CS 135, but the course was still superb. C is a very useful language. Expect to spend 10-15 hours a week on assignments, and make sure you test your code THOROUGHLY or you WILL fail the private tests. The second chances were really helpful mark-wise, but there weren't any on the last few assignments, which also took a REALLY long time.",
      "It was quite fun designing modules and finally figuring out the segmentation faults or the memory leaks. As others said, be sure to fully understand pointers and you would have a nice time in this class. There was weekly lecture video which was really nice, the professor (I think Prof Tompkins voice the video?) explains concept well. I am a slow reader so having good lecture video is wonderful for me. The first half of the class was chill, nothing too interesting. The content got really interesting after dynamic memory. Comparing to CS 135 I found this to be a little easier, I guess I just find imperative programming more intuitive. Although if you are good at math you may find functional programming more intuitive. Overall a pleasant class.",
      "Really useful course, taught me a lot of cs fundamentals and I can definitely see it being valuable. Assignments were challenging in a good way, but got harder after the midterm. ",
      "Enjoyed this overall, the assignments start off easy but get a lot more difficult after the midterm. Start working on them early because debugging and finding annoying memory leaks takes forever",
      "The main contents of this course will be useful later on such as in courses like CS246. The course contents are doable if an appropriate amount of time is spent. Very good introduction to C and memory managements. ",
      "I took CS 115(get 98) and took a break during the Spring term. I self-learned C in the Spring term. However, CS 136 still took me a lot of time that was completely out of what I expected. Every week what I do is read all the course notes (hopefully everything is identical to what I learned before), and then I spend a week finishing the assignment. Ideally, I finish all the codes on Monday, and then I have to debug until the due date and I still lost a lot of marks due to the unexpected bugs. I can't imagine anyone getting 100 in this course. I don't think a person can avoid all the tricky bugs if they do the assignments all by themselves.",
      "A bunch of assignments that force a design pattern, not fun",
      "TLDR: Very useful course, but seashell and office hours hold it back.\n\nThis course is very helpful and applicable to students, since it deals with I/O and data abstraction, and I have applied some of the concepts learned in this course (taught in C) in my own side projects (written in python). However, there were too many issues holding it back. First, Seashell is an outdated platform and it needs to be updated. I understand why the university uses it, but it often logs the user out while they are working, which is incredibly annoying. Also, the office hours were horrendous all around. Unlike cs135, where each student took 5 minutes tops and there were enough instructors and TA/ISAs to deal with the demand, often there is only one teacher, and each student takes around 15 minutes. As a result, unless you jump into the queue exactly when the office hours start, expect to wait an hour or two for your turn, or not get a turn at all (one time, I waited over 3 hours in line after joining the queue within the first 15 minutes and I never got my turn.) These issues make the course unenjoyable, especially in comparison to cs 135. \n",
      "Honestly a very fun and interesting course. Dave Tompkins' lectures are the great and very helpful. The course itself isn't too difficult if you've had previous experience with an imperative language but I can see how tough it would be if you had never programmed before. ",
      "Lectures were online but content is still digestible. I wouldn't want my worst enemy to have to code in Seashell. Assignments are fun. Fair midterm and exam. Banger course.",
      "The only complaint I had was the exam weightage. I really don't believe a computer science exam ON PAPER should be worth 50% of the grade- it's an unrealistic medium to apply what we've learned (worth half the damn grade)",
      "Fairly straightforward if you already knew how to code with Java/Python/C++ etc. already. But if CS 135 was your only experience it may be Difficult. Overall an enjoyable course, you can kinda think of it like an intro to leetcode course. Difficulty ramps up in the second half. To make sure you succeed, really understand how pointers and dynamic memory works. ",
      "Content on memory model was nice. If you have previous programming experience, the first half of the course is pretty easy, while the second half teaches some interesting (of varying usefulness) things about pointers, strings, dynamic memory, data structures. The C language is not the most useful thing in industry but this course still has a lot of concepts that can be applied across languages. ",
      "Start assignments early. Exams are tough.",
      "The assignments weren't nearly as fun as 135 but it was similar in terms of difficulty. It was a good introduction to imperative programming in C. We focused a lot on how memory works with pointers and dynamic memory. Assignments weren't too hard but writing functions in the right time complexity was challenging. The exams were kinda dumb because we had to write code by hand and sometimes you have no idea why your test cases fail. This course definitely took a lot of time but it wasn't super difficult if you don't fall too far behind.",
      "You get punished for starting assignments early because assignment instructions are dogshit. Just wait until it's midnight before the deadline and read the FAQ first. ",
      "For the most part the course was very organized and it was very clear what was expected of the students, however that doesn't mean the course didn't get tedious at times lol. The assignments tended to get a bit too long and grindy, and it was frustrating to see your code fail minor edge cases. And Seashell...",
      "Important course, very well organized when I took it (Winter 2021). Spent a long time on assignments though.",
      "This course was a really good pivot after racket from CS135 and served as a great introduction to imperative programming. It tackled every single fundamental concept and serves as a great foundation for the data structures and algorithms stuff that is so important in the future. Assignments were challenging and you should start working on them early but luckily they weren't weighted insanely heavily which was good. I would  suggest spending a lot of time on the initial 5-6 as they really help boost your assignment mark. The exams are not super theory heavy and it is crucial that you are able to code and solve problems, this is where the assignments are useful and why you should try to limit cheating. Most people wouldn't already know/learn C outside of a university context so this course serves as a way to do that.",
      "you learn C. very useful if this is your first time programming in a C style language, syntax is essentially identical in most other languages. to nonbeginner programmers, still very useful since you learn about pointers and memory management. even though high level languages don't deal with this sort of stuff, its still useful when you hear terms like \"shallow/deep copy\", \"pass by reference/value\", you really understand what that means. also the data structures are useful to know about, especially the tree stuff and O notation.",
      "Course is radically different from CS 135. Problems on assignments are no  longer algorithmic style problems, but more technical and tedious implementations of larger scaled programs that execute some task or simulate some game (an example was minesweeper). Programming language used was C.",
      "while I didn't find cs136 to be as time-consuming as cs135, I would assume the material is hard for someone new to the concepts. the course is very rich in the things it'll teach students, especially those who are used to high-level programming languages. it's definitely my favorite course from first year",
      "Took it Winter 2022 and Fall 2022 -- the restructured version in Fall 2022 was WAY better. Surprisingly enjoyed the flipped classroom and interactive-ness of lecture times, and one lecture a week was solid considering we had CS136L to do. The assignments weren't as bad as Winter, but definitely go to office hours! (Thank you Alex during office hours you are the best)",
      "Took online in W21 so not much prof interaction. Really useful introduction to more typical computer science compared to 135. Understanding C and memory management will get you so far in later courses. Assignments were time consuming but fun to figure out (minus memory management). Exams were pretty reasonable for the content.",
      "Fair and useful course.",
      "in W23, this course was so dogwater god awful underwater coral reef, coffin level graveyard. course content was actually cool, but they ran it so poorly. assignments were writing ascii art for the first half of the course, and then in the later half literally didn't explain the functions you were supposed to write. \"refer to the .expect file on how to format the print function\" -\ud83e\udd13. Literally made you self learn the whole course, only 1 lecture per week where they don't teach you anything while making shit copypasta modules and braindead assignments. im in 1b and this is definitely the worst course i will ever take in my uni career",
      "Mere words cannot describe how poorly designed and taught this course is. I would rather drop out and work at mcdonalds for the rest of my life rather than take this course again",
      "W23: Yes, CS courses require the most independent work out of most courses in UW, but even when having the utmost respect I can give to everything about this course, I swear this is the worst course in terms of how it's taught, how it's structured, and what professors provide overall (worse than BU 111 and 121 LOL). CS 135 was taught beautifully IMO and the assignment questions were more enjoyable. The silver lining is that you become way more independent, organized, and resourceful, but honestly what comes with that is... P71... and that's all she wrote. I loved Cameron Morland's attitude and straightforwardness in the classroom at least (but speaking of the classroom, 4-5 people attend the class every Thu).",
      "W23: I can't even begin to list how mind-blowingly terrible this course was. This course is a disgrace to Waterloo's faculty of Mathematics. Poorly organized. The first half of the course moved at such a slow pace for the simple content, with unbelievably cancerous (and useless) assignments. I still cannot believe I went to this school to print \"stylized X's\" in C. The second half of the course introduced some more useful content, but the assignment questions were essentially incomprehensible. I'm genuinely concerned with the writing skills of whoever wrote those problems, because maybe they'd benefit from a Grade 6 English class. Moreover, when you asked a question in the FAQ, they often replied with something stupid and condescending like: \"What does it say in the question?\". Bro, the question isn't even written in proper English. They also got us to complete our assignments in the Linux Student Environment in VSCode, which literally disconnected you every 5 minutes. For one of the assignments, literally HALF of the students stayed up until 5am, unable submit their work, because of their potato servers. As the cherry on top, there are no practice final exams. There are so many problems with this course, so either pray that they've fixed it somehow, or just take CS 146.",
      "Introductory C programming. Most of the assignments were easy, although the later parts of the course became dynamic memory hell (or just exceedingly long). This course has primarily taught me to hate C and the way it handles strings, arrays, etc. The linux servers are not as reliable as you'd think they would be, don't be surprised if the entire server goes down at some point and makes work impossible. Overall a well-managed course so long as you ignore anything to do with lectures and just look at EdX. The course can probably be completed entirely without going to a single lecture, all course content is on EdX anyways (I hate edX I hate edX!!!)\n\nHalf of the assignments are ASCII art (very easy) and the other half is dynamic memory (Valgrind & Pray). Eventually I think the course instructors got lazy because they started expecting you to figure out the entire assignment just from reading a poorly written assignment prompt. Last two assignments exemplify this problem--despite having paragraphs upon paragraphs of writing, it gets more confusing the more you look at it. Do not work in edX. Use your email to get CLion for free and work there until you need the materials on the CS servers, then work on VSCode. Valgrind will be your best friend, along with copying all of the template code from the lecture notes.",
      "Took this course in Winter 2023, and the new restructured format is terrible. \"Lectures\" are glorified tutorials where the profs just give you practice problems to do. All the actual content is self taught in horribly written, dry, boring modules. The assignments are not terribly hard, just extremely mind numbing io problems that can take hours to debug. And the server the course is run through is a literal potato so it's almost guaranteed to go down the night any assignment is due. On multiple assignments I spent more time trying to connect to the servers than actually coding. To prepare for the final we've only been given 6 extra practice problems, no sample final. Overall a terribly structured course, especially coming from the joy that was CS135.",
      "W23: Idk why they made us learn everything independently on edX and made the lectures into mediocre tutorials (I think, I did not go to any lecture after the first). Assignments took up to 4-8 hours and in addition to 3ish hours for lab, the workload was quite high. ",
      "Use Valgrind",
      "W23: Go to CS146; it's more interesting and they explain things (offline lectures) much better than what CS136 online material can do. If you persist to take CS136, I strongly advise you to still go to CS146 lectures to learn things -- it will take less time than reading CS136 course materials even though CS146 teaches more than just C. Personally I regret taking CS136, cuz I believe I could get a better grade if I chose CS146.",
      "Coming from taking cs115/116 Online during covid this course was not nearly as bad as I expected it to be. The edx modules are great, although I think it would be better if we had *real* in person lectures and the modules as supplementary notes. The first half of the course was ez but the last couple of modules and assignments require a lot of time commitment. DO NOT skip the assignments, even though your lowest gets dropped!!! they don't post solutions and some questions build off of previous assignments which is really annoying + similar assignment questions show up on the final and midterm. The ISA's this term where really chill and helpful but do try to start assignments earlier and go to the earlier office hours in the week because the ones on the day the assignments are due require you to wait like 2 hours in queue. Overall, I don't get why so many people hate the course structure this term, I guess I'm more used to self-learning but this was a really fun course, don't let other peoples comments intimidate you from taking it!!",
      "Generally speaking, I believe that I learnt many useful concepts in CS in this course. This is a really useful course in terms of contents you learn, although the first half would be useless unless you are completely new to imperative languages, which makes sense as this is an introductory course.\n\nHowever, I don't know if it's just this year, but I feel like the way that we were taught weren't enough to be successful in the course. The entire course was basically online, with lectures that teach you about the same things that you had to learn by yourself by doing the concept checks every Monday. There are some useful exercises that would help you on completing the assignments though. I really enjoyed CS 135, and I hoped that I was taught the same way for this course, with most of the learning coming from actual lectures, instead of edx. The online environment just isn't it for me. \n\nAlso, assignments. I swear about 50% of us have stayed up until 5 am at least once for the server that consistently shut down, with no announcements being made until like 1 hour before the due date. Asking questions about the assignments were also frustrating as most of the time, all we got back was \"read the question carefully,\" when the questions weren't worded clearly, I had troubles trying to interpret what the question was asking for almost every single assignment.\n\nI know that the professors and the TA's worked really hard to help us achieve our best, I don't think that this was a great learning experience for me. \n\nOverall, enjoyed the course (except the all-nighters), enjoyable lectures, and not that hard of a course if you understand how pointers work. ",
      "I don't think mere words can describe my feelings about this course. The course is unnecessarily complicated. The only time I learnt something was while doing assignments, where I had to try and test out stuff in C because the only useful sentence in the assignment instructions was \"see the expected file\". ",
      "It was a nice introduction to the intricacies of C. It was an okayish term for me. Adrian was a nice prof! It was offered online because of Covid and I guess that made it a lil boring. But very useful!",
      "The profs all collectively really pray on your downfall, and are pieces of shit sometimes. The course overall was taught pretty poorly, and I'd say it's pretty difficult to understand anything if you don't already have experience with this sort of material due to poor professor attitude and teaching style",
      "Content taught in the course is very useful, truly helps you understand some of the fundamental programming concepts (data structure, memory allocation, etc.) Nice to have access to all the course materials, but wish they would've taken slightly more hands-on teaching approach. ",
      "A good amount tougher than CS 135. Though C is typically a more familiar language to people compared to racket, ironically you'll feel like you're learning everything from scratch again after a full semester of using racket. Don't do what I did and leave some assignments to the last minute, you're gambling as some assignments are way harder than others. Bright side: both the midterm and final were fairly tame.",
      "I personally didn't find the switched class module that bad. But given I didn't really attend any CS135 lectures in the first place ... there wasn't much distinctive change. Personally though, the course was alright and the exam was decent, if somewhat on the easier side (albeit, at this point, I may or may not be jinxing myself). The assignments were a pain though. Printing stylized Xs were fine for me. But printing comma placements for integers and proper indentation of those integers, were on a different level. Dynamic memory surprisingly wasn't too bad, and to be fair, the earlier assignments were far more tedious then the later ones. (although I did have the assistance of a friendly neighbourhood chat bot). Altogether, I found instructors relatively helpful. \"relative\", as in from the below reviews, they often were a bit snappy; which is understandable... as most questions could've been answered by yourself. It is just assignments were oftentimes not truly \"complete\" until a few days later because instructions weren't written well. Of course linux servers kept crashing, but if you were attempting to finish the assignments the day it was due... well I will not provide a opinion as I also procrastinate.",
      "C sure is an important language, so it's good to have a course thay teaches it. That being said, the flipped classroom was poorly executed, and the assignments were senseless time sinks. ",

      "This course is a lot of work, but it is very useful. Learn about pointers and memory management, it'll come in handy",
      "The final exam was fair and not too hard but I did hear that a head full of people failed the exam. The assignments are stupid. Who ever creates those assignments must hate the student. Exd needs improvement to improve the teaching quality. Getting a 90 in this course is not too hard if you know what you are doing.",
      "I took CS115 and decided to challenge myself - it was a fucking challenge and I regret taking this course every single day. Single-handedly dropped my average by 4%. The lectures were absolutely useless (in class exercises) and everything was bullshit.",
      "The curriculum changed like crazy and you just hoped you studied everything they didn't tell you. No practice finals this time. Just some final review questions. Assignments were pretty stupid.\n\n\nI guess only saving grace was that my prof was a nice person with a kind personality ",
      "Learning for this course was pretty much all online. Course structure was not ideal, and some assignments were very time consuming. The in-person classes weren't too helpful since they just went over what you already learned the previous week. Exams were fair, profs were nice in person. ",
      "W23: Would recommend taking CS 146 over this if you can get it. You will learn a lot more and possibly better. I later regretted not taking CS 146.\n\nOverall, CS 136 is a decent course, very useful and easy, but just not a big fan of how it was taught. Active/flipped learning is terrible. Lectures were just useless exercises. Assignments were unnecessarily tedious and time-consuming. Some critical concepts, like pointers and modularisation that should have been taught in class, weren\u2019t. The course staff answered most doubts about assignments by saying, \u201cRead the assignment instructions\u201d. And you think, \u201cWhy do you think I asked the question? Did it even cross your mind that the instructions were unclear? It would take you less time to type the answer to the question than to type \u2018Read the assignment instructions\u2019.\u201d. They had to change test cases after the assignment due date in some assignments just because the instructions were miserable. Thus, the only problem with the course was poor management.\n\nMidterm and final exams were not difficult, but sufficient practice material wasn't provided.\n\nTAKE CS 146 IF YOU CAN.",
      "The assignments were soooooooo annoying and very time consuming, each took me about 20h but ik pple that were faster. Thoroughly test your code or you will be smoked by private tests. Also, make sure you REALLY understand assignment questions before you start coding. The content is self-taught,  I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing as long as you stay up-to-date and take notes. I wish I could redo the course with what I know now because it is definitely NOT that bad, I actually enjoyed the assignments, and coding in C really makes you understand low-level concepts you take for granted with languages like Python. I learned a lot for sure, and you will too :))",

Instead, they just ask a question as a response to your question.",
      "The content taught is extremely useful but the course was a mess. Assignments were often unclear and course staff never responded to questions until a day before the assignment due date. In general, communication was slow between students and the staff. Lectures were also useless since you were supposed to have learned everything through the EdX modules in advance, but since no one attended the lectures they added an attendance mark in the grading scheme. Start the assignments early since they're quite long, although you may not be able to work on them properly until the night before the due date anyway.",
      "Nice course, very important concepts taught but course staffs are so irresponsible because they never manage to help students out. They never respond to emails or if they did it'll take a long time. Also, they make assignment questions very intricate which requires details but they made mistakes making those errors while creating assignments but barely respond to students who are stuck on the assignment because of the assignment ambiguity WHICH COURSE STAFFS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR.",
      "CS136 has useful concepts but the assignments were more difficult than they should have been because the course staff were unresponsive and the assignment instructions were so vague and unclear.\n\nThere were no proper lectures but more focus on \"self-directed\" learning,and there was limited resources to practice for the final as well. Sometimes I felt like I was purosefully being set up to fail.",
      "This course teaches a lot of useful concepts for future cs courses. However, the course is a disaster. Assignments were tedious and often had mistakes that students could not correct. Because of that, they took a long time to finish. The course staff is extremely unresponsive and do not accommodate students for their own mistakes. My professor just read off the (often incorrectly written - insert Oops CoPy and PasTe ErrOR!!!) cluttered and confusing slides. Concept checks were often due before he even finished the module and no accommodation was given. The grading scheme is quite brutal if you cannot keep up, as you have to pass the assignments (20%), midterm (25%) and exam (50%) to even pass the course.  Overall very useful course with an embarrassingly poor execution. Thought Waterloo was known for CS? "

Also, I don't see the point of having an in-class section the day before the labs are due since I'm already done with the labs (through a very frustrating experience) by then.",
      "It's a pretty useful and easy course for beginners to computer science. Labs take maybe an hour, and answers are basically given to you by profs if you go to the in person sessions. Just make sure you fulfill the course requirements -- you need to \"pass\" all the labs and \"complete\" like 7/10 of them. I know a lot of people straight up failed because they didn't do one lab (and hence didn't \"pass\" it).",

There are some typos and some of the instructions in the course notes are wrong. Also there's too much course content fit into one week, the readings took quite a bit of time if you don't skim them. Also since the modules are fairly new, some of the readings were tricky to understand since they weren't polished. Ask lots of questions to get around these issues.",
      "It's really useful (if you're becoming a software dev) and most of it was pretty easy, but I just couldn't stand the content at all. Mandatory with CS136. If you want to be a coder/take CS136, you have to take it. Otherwise, stay in CS116.",

Just make sure you have luck on your side cuz they throw around Policy 71 like crazy and match you with random ass people, and its really hard to fight it.",
      "SUPER USEFUL. Take it as seriously as if it were a core course and you will learn a lot. The piazza is great, and the profs - especially Nomair - were very helpful. However, be aware that it is a bit more time-consuming than you d want a \"lab\" to be",
      "having no technical experience or background, and having learned programming for the first time from CS135, i found half the assignments to be horribly difficult and comparable in time-taken to math 14x assignments. however the other half were very very easy. the biggest tip of advice is to attend every single in person session because the profs can be a lot of help when you're stuck on questions",
      "Labs 3 and 4 were the hardest but the rest were pretty easy. Take this course seriously even if you don't want to, it's probably one of the most useful courses in terms of content.",

It really depends on your high school experience, work experience and side projects.  I know kids in my class who probably could've got high 90s on the final without even taking the course. However, for me personally, with very limited programming experience upon entering the program, this course was one of my more challenging ones.  A few tips; do NOT skip assignments, even though they're worth 1% of your final grade each. While they aren't worth a lot, it's really important to become familiar with, and apply the concepts learned in class, and the assignments are great for this. Secondly, do not JUST do the assignments and think you know your stuff; study them. Make sure you test your own code, and understand edge cases.  And finally, CS for some reason has the reputation of being the 'easy' course in 1A. Do not just assume you know your stuff heading into the midterm and final; even if you're a well-seasoned programmer, spend a few hours in study. While this course was reasonably challenging for me, due to my lack of prior CS experience, I managed to scratch and claw my way to a 91, so this course is very feasible, regardless of the background you're coming from.",

Assignments are quite long and time-consuming if you're not one of those cracked coding kids in the cohort, but they are definitely doable if you invest your time in going to office hours and learning on your own. The midterm and finals were kind of stressful and more difficult than the actual course lecture notes and were pretty similar to the assignment questions. Mind you, you have 7 days for 2-3 assignment questions and only 20-30mins per midterm/final question, so you really need to be good and confident at coding before attempting any exams. However, Professor Victoria is one of the best professors I've ever had, and I really believe you should consider yourself lucky if you do manage to get her as your instructor. Very supportive and friendly, and will always listen to whatever you have to say. We love you, Victoria!",

      "Very poor first-year programming course. C is one of the most notoriously difficult programming languages, and teaching it during the first term is ridiculous. The assignments were poorly written and were overly-complicated compared to the material learned in class. The course is poorly-taught as well. Topics like binary search trees are not taught until 2nd or 3rd year in other programs, so why teach them now? I did not learn anything from this course. The course slides were poorly presented and it felt overly rushed. Oh, and the final exam is 30 pages with questions as difficult as the assignments. AND new topics are introduced on the exam. Be prepared to spend 20 minutes trying to understand ONE question on the exam, and multiply that by 3.",
      "This course is taught using the programming language C and the difficulty of the course can vary depending on your background knowledge of coding.\n\nFor me, I was relatively new to programming so the content taught in class took a while for me to understand. If you have Victoria Sakhnini as your professor, she will go over the content very clearly in class but during lectures, she has these \"clicker questions\" where it's sort of like multiple choice questions that asks you what does this code snippet do. In the beginning they weren't too bad, but they get progressively more challenging and requires you to do a little more thinking. However, it didn't take long to fully grasp what the code snippet does afterwards. She will also go over the code snippet afterwards too.\n\nI found the assignments assigned as not beginner friendly. If you ever need help or are stuck with something, I suggest you go to your professor's office hours to clarify things or ask your TA's for help. That was what I did when I got stuck with assignments and it was really helpful. I suggest you do the same if this happens to you.",

      "Assignments are lots of fun, but tests are difficult.  Curved at the end of term, had a great experience taking this course.",
      "Racket is bae",
      "Awesome course, explores some highly theoretical topics such as models of computation and lambda calculus. Shoutout to Ashish Mahto, the best ISA in the world!",
      "Quite difficult, but I loved the material and it was very useful.",
      "2017F, Cormack. A good course in general plusTA (Ashish) was extremely helpful. Bombed the first midterm but ended as my highest mark of the term. ",
      "Amazing course, highly recommended to take it, but be ready to work hard. Also if you have a good ISA like I did (Ashish Mahto), be sure to go to his office hours and let him help you!",
      "Great if you're a lambda enthusiast.\nPrepare to write lots of Racket. But fear not, you do write useful algorithms instead of maintaining code style like CS135.",
      "Maybe I'm biased because I love haskell and functional programming in general, but I found this to be a fun and engaging course in the second half. The first half was a bit boring, but it gets worth it for the end. Mind you, if you've never done functional programming before, Racket and the lambda calculus can be infuriating. But I definitely enjoyed it.",
      "Most people in the class are very smart, but it's probably one of the easier advanced classes. Initial assignments were pretty easy, but got much harder once Lambda comes along. It can get frustrating at times with efficiency restrictions but at least you don't need to deal with the 135 design recipes. ",
      "Unlike CS135, it's more theoretical and you don't have to care about code style. Easier than MATH145 and MATH147. All hail the lambda.",
      "I really enjoyed the class. Cormack is a really funny and engaging professor. The two midterms and finals were not really hard in my opinion but you do need to memorize and pay attention to the lectures to get a good grade.",
      "Very interesting course. Covers many interesting materials. No design recipe. Recommended for who had prior experience in programming.",
      "The course itself isn't too challenging if you have prior experience with programming. Getting used to the functional paradigm might take a while, but once you get used to it the assignments are quite simple. Be prepared for a slight increase in difficulty at the end though.",
      "My favourite course of 1A! It was really interesting learning about the programming concepts and although half the assignments were pretty challenging, it was extremely satisfying once you got them right (you can see if your code pasts all the tests or not on a cooldown). Furthermore, the tight-knit (online) community for CS145 was sublime. It was incredible conversing with so many super smart people and the TAs (Rivers and Benjamin) were really helpful, knowledgeable, and welcoming. If you like CS and you have the option to take this course - TAKE IT!!",
      "The end of the course got kind of hard. Taken online.",
      "Racket is overall a useless programming language, but I do learn a lot from this course. Some of the material in the latter half of the course is highly related to future courses (computer architecture, RAM, IO stream, etc). Also, the rock-paper-scissor and the Karatsuba algorithms assignments were really fun.",
      "The assignments are very well-designed, so if you just do them you will be good. The material is interesting and there is not as much busywork as CS 135 so I recommend taking it if you have the option.",
      "The best 1A course I have taken and I enjoyed the challenge. There were times I literally died but looking back I had an absolute blast. It's a tough course but 100% worth it. ",
      "Difficulty sky rockets after the second mid term. Other than that, it is a great course, Cormack teaches pretty well and the grade distribution between assignments and exams is well balanced.",
      "Interesting course that starts easy and gets more difficult after each midterm. Having basic knowledge in programming concepts will help, but if you are willing to put in extra time, the course isn't that difficult. Overall, the course teaches important CS concepts regardless if you think Racket/functional programming is useless.",
      "If you have previous coding knowledge it is easy and fun, no stupid design template like in 135",
      "I am in CS so I might be biased, but this course was definitely my favourite from 1A. 12 weekly assignments (60%), two midterms (10% each) and a final (20%), but I took this course online (Fall 2021) so the weights may be different in person. Overall this course was great at teaching some core computer science concepts, and most importantly how to think critically and solve tough problems, which is much more important than CS 135\u2019s design recipe. Even though this course teaches Racket, a lot of the content and problem-solving skills will transfer over to other languages, so this is definitely not a useless course. Some of the reviews seem to find this course very easy and others very tough, it definitely depends on the person but I think everyone can agree that the course gets harder as it goes on. That being said, I also found it got a lot more interesting too, and the final assignments were generally the most fun and interesting of the term. For me, I found the assignments took comparable time on average to MATH 135 (around 6-ish hours) and most of them were doable in one day, although the first few assignments were a little quicker and the final 3 assignments took longer to finish. I would definitely recommend anyone who has prior programming experience to try this course. You can always drop down if it\u2019s not for you, it\u2019s definitely not as bad as the advanced math courses (145 and 147) and it was a really great experience!",
      "Professor Cormack and the ISAs were extremely helpful. Try to squeeze as many marks before the final before you bomb it. I spent around 5 hours/week on the assignments so it was no biggie. The final was hard. ",
      "CS 145 really helped me understand recursion on another level and was really great at introducing new concepts with assignments. The course was 60% assignments, 20% for 2 midterms, and 20% for the final. I found the assignments really challenging (especially after the second midterm) but really worthwhile and satisfying to do. The final was hard, although most of my friends had close to full marks before the final. Overall would recommend if you want to learn a lot and grow as a programmer!",
      "Pretty good course. Some of the assignments weren't very fun/interesting, but it's whatever. ",
      "Fairly straightforward, most questions are fun puzzles except this one stupid question where you play rock paper scissors against a bot with an unknown strategy so the solution becomes extremely luck dependent. This course involved more actual problem solving than 135 from what I heard due to the unnecessary design recipes (coined as \"hot garbage\" by Cormack and the TA's), so I would recommend this if you have any coding experience. Only downside of this course would be that Racket is an utterly useless and illegible language.",
      "Assignments got way harder at the end of the course, but they also got much more fun/interesting to do. Not that hard to get a good mark, but you do need to put legitimate effort.",
      "Starts out easy, difficulty ramps up significantly in the last third",
      "A really interesting and fun course that starts of slow, but ends with some tougher assignments. The assignments are pretty fun, and Gordon Cormack is an amazing professor. Definitely take this course over 135 if you have previous computing experience (not that it will necessarily help a lot)\n\nThe end of the course features some imperative programming with machine language which is also very interesting. Overall a very fun course!",
      "Everything was easy. But the finals was hard af. However, it is very possible to get an almost perfect mark pre-finals even for students without a lot of previous coding background (such as myself). Plus, the finals was only worth 20%, so a low finals did not really affected much.",
      "Starts out very easy, ramps up quite significantly, but for anyone who's experienced with programming, it's not all that bad.\n\nThe note about how previous experience can hinder you is true, in a way. You need to rethink how you're writing programs instead of taking what you'd think of as the most intuitive option.",
      "Took it without previous coding experience. The assignments are a grind, especially starting from the second midterm. Currently on 2B term, and looking back, I would not have taken this if I were a first-year student because the enrichment from CS 135 is pretty useless to me. I don't think I will ever use lambda calc and machine code to program again (at least I don't plan to take upper-yr courses involving those). Also not useful for preparation for future cs courses: the release tokens made me lazy to test edge cases, which is CRUCIAL for the courses you take later on.",
      "Before I continue, let me say that I HEAVILY recommend this course over cs 135. This is the perfect re-introduction into CS, if you have already been doing it informally. You will see concepts you already knew, but repeated in a more formal manner (such as big O notation) and it is a delight to re-learn things you had an intuition for properly. That said however, my year's course offering felt very scuffed and disorganised. Lectures were either extremely vital or completely useless. And they either covered nothing of substance and repeated themselves, or covered too much than could be easily digested in one sitting. I am currently writing this whilst sitting in a useless lecture where I walked through the cold to get to the theatre only to be treated to no prof, and instead a pre-recorded MIT lecture from the 90s or something. \n\nI had access to some notes and recordings from previous course offerings and they feel much better organised and laid out, so I am very confused as to what happened here.\n\nThe assignments are good but difficult: expect to spend a lot of time on them. Some assignment problems will genuinely change the way you think about programming. Some will make you bash your head against a wall till it bleeds. Your classmates will either be shockingly good or shockingly bad at assignments. \n\nOverall, the pace of assignments is too high and does not match the pace of lectures. One time I sat through a lecture where the prof talked for an hour about an assignment that half the class had done and the other half hadn't even thought of starting. What was the point of that??\n\nAt least this is much much better than the absolute mess that is CS 135. It makes you appreciate lisp and see why it's magic. Take it if you have programming experience like you already know what a tree is. Believe me, CS 135 is a dark hole most emerge from with a hatred for one of the best programming paradigms I have ever had the pleasure of using.",
      "This course is the to-go course if you have prior coding experience. As the other reviews said, the difficulty skyrockets after the second midterm. Can be in for a grind but better than suffering design recipe in CS135",
      "Having general knowledge of CS going in is very helpful. The course has minimal busywork and the assignments help a lot with understanding.  Great course.",
      "Pretty easy for the most part if you've done competitive programming in high school. The difficulty ramps up toward the end, so watch out for that (I love machine code). ",
      "Course was enjoyable and somewhat easy until after the second midterm. Even with prior competitive programming experience, the difficulty and effort required to tackle lambda calc and friends is brutal. Expect spending 10+ hours on assignments weekly and a nuclear final. Would not recommend taking this over CS 135, unless you really really enjoy learning about pure cs and are confident in your programming skills.",
      "Even if you have a solid programming background, the assignments are a nice rerun of the foundations in a functional programming context. Do be warned though, you'll be dreaming of parentheses due to the use of Racket.",
      "Not the easiest course but very fun! Cormack is a legend and that's about all I needed to take this course but the content was usually engaging and well-taught. Some weeks, I wouldn't even go to the lectures/tutorials/office hours and still managed to finish the assignments based on simple coding knowledge as the questions mostly had to do with intuition and problem-solving rather than being able to find the appropriate Racket tools. Overall, chill course but as everyone else already mentioned, it ramps up a bit towards the end, but it isn't anything unmanageable. Hope you have fun if you do take it, though :))",
      "Very interesting course overall, assignments are pretty easy if you pay attention in class. Midterm and Final were very fair.",
      "Was skeptical of functional programming going in but this course opened my eyes to its real beauty. The assignments near the end were quite challenging but also really fun to do. Biggest benefit is not having to write design recipes and check-expects. Definitely take this course if you can."

If you're in AFM, math, business or CS, this course could be helpful in either raising your average or teaching you how to use slightly more advanced tools with software.",
      "It is a really useful course. It teaches you many things about basic usage of computers and also, takes you in depth like scripting in MS Excel. Assignments were straightforward and were easy.",

      "\"Bird Course\"...but assignments take forever to complete",
      "Took this course online during the Winter 2021 term with Barbara Daly. It was a pretty easy and usually a fun course. Learned a lot about Microsoft Word, proper design techniques, photo editing, databases, and a bit about SQL and HTML. I didn't find the course videos that were provided to be particularly useful, and most of the content that you couldn't understand could be searched up on Google. The final unit on FileMaker databases was a bit tricky since most people were not familiar with the program but it was cool to see the final product of a database come to life. Overall, this is a course that I recommend as an elective and the difficulty depends on whether or not you have some prior experience with the course content. ",
      "The course was one of the most practical and useful courses I've taken so far in university. It really embodies \"Give a man a fish, and you feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you feed him for a lifetime.\" While we did look at specific software like MS Word, Excel, FileMaker, etc., all of the units were accompanied by pearls that taught you how to apply what you're learning to almost any software. After taking this course, not only do I feel comfortable using some of the most common programs like MS word and Excel, but I am not afraid to explore new software if I have to. My favourite part about the course was the fact that along with learning the technical skills, it also teaches you how to be resourceful. \n\nThe course is very well organized. The professor, Barbara, makes an active effort to keep students engaged (through fun discussions on Teams) and is incredibly helpful during office hours. The assignments are reasonable and actually help you learn. There is plenty of help and a lot of resources available to help you through the assignments. ",

      "The course module is overall well-organized, however, the lecture time is useless and time-wasting. Only the lab helps do the assignments. \nLearning this course is basically studying by yourselves since the lecture content does not have any relationship with all tests. Therefore, going through over 40 pages of study question bank (without the answer) before each exam is the only key to saving your mark for this course. \nAlso, there are some topics and software which are rarely used nowadays, I really cannot see the reason for learning such topics.  ",
      "Assignments take a long time, but overall a great course! Interesting applications and concepts, though each is only covered at surface level due to the number of them. Highly recommend taking it for a general overview of computer functions. ",
      "Some people would say that its a bird course in the sense that the content is easy to understand conceptually however the amount of time each weekly 4% assignment takes is really disproportionate to how little it is weighted. ",

Topics include Word, Excel, Databases, Pixel Graphics, Photo Editing and more. \nExams are fair but not straightforward, you will definitely want to read lecture slides before going in.",

Be warned however that the first half of the course I found super easy and redundant, and then really really picks up in the second half with the more advanced MIPS stuff and computer internals. Assignment averages went from 90 to around 60 near the end of the course. Material got much easier in the last 2 weeks.\n\nOne big critisism I have for the course though is that when I took it, assignment solutions were not released which I've never encountered in any other course. Only sort of solutions we got were test cases for MIPS questions (which were only on like 3/6 of the assignemnts). Also, the weekly quizzes were only made avalaible for a period of 24 hours, I would much prefer if they were avaliable for an extra day or two prior to the deadline and not have the 24 hour window to do it. \n\nAdvice: Attend every lecture! Lots of examples are discussed in class that arent in the lecture slides. Also found the lecture slides to be quite dull and not explain material fully",

The coding at the low level really doesn't have any external use but figuring out how to write complicated programs with a very limited instruction set required a bit of creativity which was enjoyable. The biweekly assignments were manageable, although the weekly quizzes were tough, especially with a full course load. No midterm and the final exam was surprisingly light.",

Furthermore, the assignments covered a lot of the content and were very useful in understanding the course material, however, be prepared to go to office hours. Besides that, the midterm and final was very easy. Definitely recommend taking this course with Prof Murray!",
      "Pretty straightforward course covering a broad series of topics. Only one of the 4 modules was on assembly code, which was quite fun to do and wasn't very difficult to do assignments on. Difficulty does pick up in the remaining weeks, but as long as you go to lectures and take notes on the examples covered, you should be fine. Going to lectures is almost mandatory because the slides posted don't contain a lot of information apart from general knowledge. The assignments were well scattered aross the term being due bi-weekly, something that CS116 didn't do very well when I took it. Prof mentioned one of the assignments being the hardest, but I personally didn't find it to be difficult at all as it really only relied on your understanding of MIPS register conventions. There was a lot of material covered across the term and studying for all of it was a bit of a worry, but the final exam was suprisingly straightforward and easy. Lots of students including myself were able to complete the exam an hour or more early.",

The 4 assignments in the course were fun to do, although were somewhat long (but not neccesarily difficult). I honestly found the lectures to be dry and not needed, as the online module on EDX is just so well laid out and engaging; whoever put together the online module did an amazing job. Another thing to add is that this course does not need a lot of time given the relatively light workload.Would reccommend this course if you liked ADTs from 1st year CS courses",
      "Could be taken as a birdy course by those who take CS136/CS246 though switching to Python might be a minor problem. Not difficult in general. Go through many fundamental but useful ADT's. Some are, however, harder to comprehend, such as AVL trees, 2-3 trees, hash, but this course does not go into details (at least for Spring22).  Students are expected to pay as much attention to the theories as to writing codes.",
      "Super easy. If you have taken 136, even if you don't know python this class is a joke. Majority of assignments are implementing ADT's.",
      "This is the worst course I have ever taken. The modules are like reading a book and offer little explanation of concepts. The assignments then ask you to code various different data structures, which is extremely difficult considering there are essentially no examples with code. Think about it this way: you read a math textbook with few examples that don't actually get solved using theorems, but instead using words telling you HOW YOU would do it; the assignment comes around and it asks you to solve questions 10x as difficult as the \"examples\" except this time use the theorems and some magical intuition that you should somehow have. \n\nAvoid this course at all costs. ",
      "This is not a bird course(anymore) for students taking CS116.",
      "I guess it is ok - I would say CS 231 is much more useful as well as much easier than this. The writing part is about the same difficulty but the coding part is MUCH harder than CS 231. Yet overall it is manageable (it just requires many many many hours of testing and debugging... but the logic is not too hard for me who took CS 116). But if you were to have an elective for CS and you have an option between CS 231 and 234, take 231",
      "Coming from cs136, very birdy. Course had 4 assignments and no final exam, only final assessment which we have week to do. \n\nFor assignments, one half was written, was time consuming and irritating but doable, then the coding part was usually pretty easy, however the marking was abysmal. \nMost Assignment averages were in the 40s/50s. The tests were run in a way that if you get one test wrong, you get them all wrong. If you implemented a function even a bit different than they expected despite passing all tests, 50% deduction. I think there was an equal probability of getting a 100, 50, and 0 on the assignments. ",
      "I took the online, asynchronous version of this course. The topics covered in this class are ones that I found very interesting and I think will be very useful. The course assumes you already know how to code, their are resources to help, but the focus of the course is not on how to write code, but is much more theoretical and based on bigger ideas. Assignments were worth a lot and it is very important to read the instructions. Lots of office hours and staff were very active in office hours. I found the lecture content and videos engaging and usually easy to follow. ",
      "The course content could have been interesting if taught in a better way and so were the assignments. Assignments are formed half written half coding, the coding can get really hard and time-consuming because of how iffy they wrote its description, can easily get a low mark in coding.\nHowever, the marking scheme is basically free so you can still easily get a high mark.",

There were also 5 minitests (basically quizzes) @ 2% each, although these allowed for unlimited tries. They took me multiple tries each though.\nThe midterms and final (25% each for 2 MTs, 30% final) were open book, untimed midterms and we were given a bit less than a week for each. The instructors said each time, the midterm/final was designed to be completed in a normal timespan (2 hours/2.5 hours) plus a bit extra for formatting in Latex. Each time the given time was a gross underestimate, at least for me. I easily took >10 hours for each midterm to just do the questions and >15 hours for the final.

It can get hard to understand at times, so it's important to do assignments and ask questions. Be prepared for the exams as there are so many things you need to remember and understand.",
      "I hated the course at first, but after the midterm it got a lot better. Most of the lecture videos suck (depending on who made them), in person lectures were much better. The lecture slides also had a lot of typos in them, and at times were unclear. Assignments required a lot of time and thought.",
      "This course kinda felt like new modules don't build on previous ones. One week you're learning about dictionaries and the next you're learning about compression algorithms, and they're in their own content bubble that doesn't depend on knowing previous info. \n\nidk it just feels like brute force memorizing instead of getting deep insight into a single topic. the data structures/algorithms are useful though.",
      "Useful, yes - to some extent. But I was not a fan of the course structure and assignments. The actual concepts you learn like hashing and pattern matching are super useful but they throw in a ton of math/abstract stuff in there as well. I also wasn't a fan of the online teaching style and low effort by instructors (W22).",
      "Very useful for COOP (since you'll need to know data structures) but this course is alot of work and quite difficult.",
      "Definitely the hardest course of 2B for me, but maybe that's just because I took it over coop. Very math-heavy. The content got harder as the term went on but the assignments got easier (don't ask me how). The programming questions are really stupid though (they make you do a lot of really dumb things that theoretically make sense but are hard/impractical to put into code, and are very vague regarding the requirements) and should probably just be tossed. \n\nBut there hasn't been any course that's made me go \"holy shit, that's so fucking smart!\" as many times as I did during this one. Overall very interesting and useful. I wouldn't have gotten my second co-op job (I had to use hashing during the interview) without it.",
      "Mostly useless, but I happened to land a co-op that utilizes a lot of the DFA knowledge. ",

      "Very difficult but foundational course. Concepts are super useful, proofs.. not so much. Extremely proof based course with unexpectedly time-consuming programming exercises sprinkled in worth 2% each. Wish they focused more on how to implement some of the data structs/algos presented instead of the math behind them. Midterms and Finals prep are super grindy like every other proof based course.",
      "The content for the course is pretty interesting. You get to learn about a lot of different data structures and algorithms. The assignments are pretty easy to get high marks on, but the midterm and final are pretty tough. You should definitely attend lectures for this class because some of the data structures/algorithms are way easier to understand in lectures than from just the slides. Compared to either, the course notes are terrible for learning the material, they are written like Calc course notes (very mathematical and hard to understand from reading).",
      "Introduces data structures and algorithms that will be relevant in future courses and LeetCode interviews. Didn't enjoy runtime theory and proofs that are only useful in the real world in niche situations.\n\nOverall, a very easy course that teaches a lot.

      "Probably the most challenging 2nd year CS course, but the contents are extremely useful and interesting. Exams and assignments are hard, but doable with lots of practice. The contents get harder as the term progresses, but the averages go up. Don't ask why. Stay up to date with lectures, do the tutorial questions, try to understand the materials and the logistics behind them, and review with past midterms/finals. You'll be fine.",

Found first and third week, asymptotic notation and randomized algorithm with expected runtime and average runtime to be quite tough. The rest, however, were not tough conceptually.\n\nI found all of the courses to be interesting overall, assignments were biweekly which is very nice. Just attend lectures and pay close attention, you should be fine. Slides are not sufficient (it lacks quite a few important details), if you skip lectures read the course note and the slides. There are also books on the stuff covered that might offer better explanation than the course note.",
      "Great course, very useful for interviews and becoming a better programmer. Starts off hard with algorithm analysis and randomized algorithms, but gets much easier as the term goes on as you do less analysis and perform more algorithms. Most of the course content is very interesting, especially compression and pattern matching. Don't attend lectures if your prof just reads off the slides, if they provide more than that definitely attend.",
      "Took this in Fall 2022. The assignments and final exam were pretty fair, the midterm less so. You get to learn a lot of useful data structures as well as ways to work with data (compression, string searching, etc.), but unfortunately, this course was primarily focused on proofs and analysis, so there wasn't many opportunities to actually put your knowledge to practice through code (ie. this prepares you for leetcode, but is *not* leetcode)",
      "Revise the topics regularly\n",
      "The algorithms portion of the course is pretty difficult, the data structures portion is pretty easy, so it kind of balances out. This course mainly gives a good intro to how you should approach algorithms and time complexity for the future, but it requires a decent amount of attention and practice to fully get. If you at least read everything and try on the assignments, you should be ok.",
      "Hard course especially in the first half if you are not proficient in proofs. Second half was more about understanding how various algorithms worked and was much more interesting and easier to do than the first.\nVery useful for interviews.",

      "Tries to be proof heavy without the rigorlty. We ended up having to explain hand waving on assignments praying that TA bless marks. The data structures are cool and useful tho.",
      "The best complement I can give to this course is that CS241 was so bad, I don't really have an opinion about this course.",
      "In theory, this course should be very useful as data structures is one of the core components of a CS curriculum. However, waterloo emphasizes a very mathematical approach to the topic in the first half which is fine but a lot of the proofs end up being very hand-wavy, and you can't really focus on the underlying data structures because of all the confusing math. The 2nd half of the course is even worse as you just do useless algorithms by hand. It's a little bit easier but mind-numbingly boring. The only somewhat useful modules of this course are Big-O analysis, Hashing, and Priority Queues. ",
      "Lots of math and theory, and little focus on application of data structures. Expect to do stuff like writing proofs with nested summations to prove nested for loops are O(n^2). Second half was better, no more proofs, and more focus on learning algorithms and designing algorithsm to solve certain problems. It was pretty difficult in the first half, but you'll be able to recover your grade on the final.",
      "I found the first half of this course extremely difficult and confusing (a lot of complicated yet hand-wavy proofs). The second half wasn\u2019t as hard, but still pretty unenjoyable (a lot of performing algorithms by hand). Overall my least favourite CS course so far.",
      "Should be a lot more useful but we spend too long learning about unneccessarily complicated details.",
      "Learned a lot of different data structures and algorithms! First half of the course was Big-O notation, Average/Expected runtime and some Sorting algorithms. Second half of the course went through a lot of algorithms for things like finding a string in a text, encoding and decoding etc. I like how the course wasn't purely application and required you to think deeper to combine concepts for midterm/exam questions! ",
      "Course gets easier as it goes since the beginning is theoretical and proof-heavy and later it becomes mostly application of data structures. Final exam was very fair with a lot of questions being easy as long as you understand how each data structure works. There were also two coding assignments that were not worth much, but were a good change.",

      "amazing course. very useful",
      "Great course! Really gives you a theoretical understanding of asymptotic bounds and what big-O really means. The first half is typically considered difficult since it includes a LOT of proofs but if you clearly understand the fundamental meaning of average and expected case runtimes then it shouldn't be too hard. Second half is just a bunch of string matching algos, trees and compression and hashing techniques. I think Alexis made the final exam and it was pretty fair as it tested what the course aims at teaching.",
      "Wish there were more programming questions, although they were free marks. Pretty fun and useful course overall.",
      "Horribly ran. TAs and one of the professors were actively hostile, the topics could make an insomniac fall asleep, and my professor was the worst lecturer I have ever seen. The course overall though is easy in terms of content (it's just big-O notation and simple proofs), and only gets harder when the course gets in its own way.",
      "Wasn't the best run course this term with the profs not really being the best, but the content was definitely useful, albeit slightly harder to grasp. We did a lot of runtime proofs which helps you drill the concepts in your mind and looked at a few data structures which helps as well. Useful course but the overall experience wasn't the best.",
      "Assignment are based on PPTs, to prepare for the tests, make sure you understand how each ADTs work, would be fine. Interesting course overall, lots of data structures, pretty fun. But algorithm alnalysis is boring I think, especially expected costing time. Designing algorithm is easy actually, as long as you read the PPTs carefully and understanding how structures work. Usually the designing algorithm in assignment just need you to change a little bit from the PPT's algorithm, its's not a kind of IQ test but just make sure you know what the algorithm is doing I think. ",
      "Not very well run. Very little coding and a lot of proofs. Content is kinda cool and it definitely could be a fun course if run better. Not that hard overall but some assignment qs can be tricky",
      "Definitely a useful course. We didn't have enough time to go through all of the course content though. I feel like the difficulty was pretty equal pre and post midterm, unlike what some other posts here said. The course gatekeeps tutorial solutions though which got pretty annoying, especially because the solutions they gave in-class were very handwavy, and featured techniques from TAs such as \"proof by sus\", and they frequently said we couldn't do what they did in the tutorials on our assignments because it was not rigorous enough."

      "You learn how to build a machine language compiler, scan and parse code",
      "I really enjoyed this course, esp. having it in parallel with ece 222. assignments are incremental, and can get repetitive. Interesting concepts though.",
      "Fantastic course.  Large workload, but very interesting and well worth understanding.",
      "Course is relatively interesting, you get to write a very basic compiler. I found the first half of the course pretty easy, with the second part on languages more complex. The assignments all vary in difficulty and length, but are quite easy and you get instant marks from Marmoset. ",
      "Great course to teach you about assembly and compiling. Loved it.",
      "Do all the assignments! Important to doing well in the course.",
      "kinda useless if you are not gonna work in the field of compilers ",
      "Course is fun and cool, getting to create a compiler. Good exposure to assembly code too. ",
      "Go to classes and do assignments weekly , they are dependent.",
      "Really liked this course!",
      "Awesome course, assignments teach you a lot!! Make sure to attend the tutorials, they really help with completing the assigned work. Material covered is great, sure to be useful in industry.",
      "fairly easy especially as an upper year CS course! remember to finish all the assignments and memorize some important concepts.",
      "A fun course. Assignments (assembler, parser and compiler for a simple C-like language on a virtual CPU) give a sense of accomplishment at the end. ",
      "You get to build a compiler and learn a lot about tokenizers, DFAs, and grammars",
      "Very useful and interesting course!",
      "pretty heavy workload for a 2nd year cs course but also probably the most interesting 2nd year cs course.",
      "Interesting to learn about compilers, stay ahead of your assignments and it's enjoyable.",
      "I thought I liked this course in the beginning, but the theory became so heavy and dry, I was bored out of my mind by the end of the course. Most people enjoy this course, I unfortunately, did not.",
      "Great intro to what CS courses look like in later years. Relevant content and fun assignments",
      "Super long assignments.  Unnecessarily long.  Material was very interesting though!",
      "Start assignments early and be careful. Most of the later assignments build on each other, so you will want a strong foundation to work with. Things will not work the first time you run them, so be patient.",
      "Interesting course. Assignments can be very long and time-consuming, but not horribly difficult",
      "The assignments were easy but they screwed up our midterm. It was incredibly difficult. It was nothing like assignments. If you're doing well in assignments, don't assume you can do well on the midterm or that you're prepared. You have to know every single detail extremely well for the midterm. At least for this term.",
      "interesting course where you can have a pretty good idea of how a program in c or c++ or java or w/e is translated into 0s and 1s",
      "Assignments were tedious but interesting",
      "You write a simple compiler and learn about some basic theory about languages. It's an alright course in terms of making you write code, but I'm not a biggest fan of the content.",
      "I actually took the first offering of CS 241e, which is the enriched version of CS 241. It was taught in Scala. It was pretty interesting, and I would highly recommend taking the enriched version over the normal version. ",
      "Interesting information, long assignments",
      "You learn about stuff that are completely made up just for this course. However, the ideas and knowledges in this course are very useful if you are interested in compilers and stuff, and they are more important than the long and tedious assignments. If you can't pass all the tests that's probably fine since the focus is not on your c++ or scheme skills. ",
      "The assignments are the key since this is still more a programming course than not. They don't have secret tests though, so it makes it easier to get perfect on your assignments. Midterm/final wasn't bad at all. Really cool stuff to learn; parsing, formal grammars, and assembly language at the start and end.",
      "Taught in a very functional-programming way, which made it difficult for me (I didn't learn Scheme).",
      "Really fun material, some of which was review/a small extension of CS 146 but the assignments were great.  Lectures were spent frantically copying down notes from the board as there were no course notes available.",
      "CS is getting hardcore from here.",
      "CS 241e: A really interesting course. It went into a bit more depth then the regular course, such as implementing closures. There wasn't too much on writing actual assembly, it was more focused on making abstractions. It was relatively easy, especially if you understand pointers and CS136's memory model well.",
      "It wasn't difficult per se, just a lot of work because of the weekly assignments. Found it pretty enjoyable.",
      "Favourite course of the term - and probably, my entire degree. Average workload and difficulty, interesting content, well taught.",
      "Took the first offering of CS241e (enriched). My favourite computer science course so far, we built a compiler for a subset of Scala through assignments, which used a lot of what we learned in class. So studying for exams wasn't that bad, as if you did the assignments yourself, you already understand most of the material",
      "I took the enriched section and it was great. Interestingly I think it was easier than the normal section. The enriched section uses Scala and the way the assignments and Marmoset tests work is the nicest of any course I have ever taken.",
      "Pace of the assignments was a little crazy - 2 weeks for each of the simple assignments, then suddenly 1 week only for each of the hard assignments at the end.  Straightforward exams though.",
      "You will basically learn how the compiler works. I found it was very interesting when Troy taught it. If you get Troy in your term, you will definitely love the course.",
      "The assignments take brutally long and was one of the main reasons I struggled to keep up in my other courses this term. However, the assignments are interesting and build upon one another, so you definitely want to aim for perfect on all of them. You can achieve this relatively easily (time consuming, but not too hard). The content is interesting though not necessarily applicable to your work terms. The exams for our term were relatively fair (thought I have some complaints). Overall an 80+ is rather easily achievable if you do the assignments well and really understand the material. I would recommend doing tutorial assignments.",
      "easier than 246 and more fun",
      "Make sure you do all the assignments, as they build on each other.",
      "Compared to all your other programming-heavy CS courses, this one is quite light. Useful knowledge to see how higher level languages are interpreted by the machine. Also, Racket is bae.",
      "One of the best courses I've ever taken",
      "One of the most inspiring and interesting second year CS course.",
      "Definately the most interesting course I've ever taken in my life.\nIt really gave me a deep appreciation for how software works.\nAnd the assignments! Oh man, those were awesome!\nBuilding a Assembler and a Compiler from scratch! Wow!\n\nSidenote, I made a emulator for the MIPS architecture used the course, and added some nice features unavailable on the java based one (i.e: step-by-step debugging). Check it out at http://prilik.ca/mips241 ",
      "I took the enriched version of this course (CS241E). The assignments were VERY time consuming (~20 hours on avg per week for me, mainly spent on debugging). However, the exams were surprisingly very straight forward, but with no practice exams or sample questions provided before the exams. The contents tested are somewhat different compared to the assignments(no scala code). I went into the course without any prior knowledge and it definitely was hard learning both Scala, MIPS and computer architecture at the same time.  The speed that the prof teaches at is probably better for the people who are reviewing this content.",
      "Great course, took me a few weeks but eventually the scope and understanding of what exactly we were doing in this course hit me. Well laid out weekly assignments that, at times, could be pretty difficult. Still much easier than CS246 was. Not sure how useful this class will be, but it was interesting if anything.",
      "I took the enriched offering, and it has been my favourite course so far. Long assignments, but exams were not too bad.",
      "Really fascinating introduction to how computers *really* work. As a SE student, it's really useful taking it alongside ECE 222.\n\nAlso, I highly recommend taking CS 241E if you can. It goes in a lot more depth than the regular course, plus there are no secret test cases!",
      "The course is just a giant buildup to building your first compiler. It teaches how all the components of the compiler work; scanner, parser, context sensitive analysis, and code generation. Expect to spend a lot of time on assignments, but less than 246. I did the assignments in C++. If you are good at C++ and know what you are doing, it's not hard. If you aren't, use another language. ",
      "CS241E (Enriched): Course was enjoyable, straightforward, and useful. Knowing how programming languages are implemented gives a greater appreciation when using high-level constructs. Assessments were fair and the assignments were well-organized. Marmoset tests for assignments were fair and didn't try to do anything tricky or sneaky (the focus is on making sure your compiler actually compiles properly) - they were better organized than most prior courses that used Marmoset assignment submission. Course seems easier and more fun than non-enriched version, so if 241E is running and you have the desired prerequisite marks, consider giving it a try! We spent less time playing around in MIPS assembly and instead wrote abstractions earlier on in the course to save time, compared to the non-enriched sections.",
      "Best course ever!",
      "Fair midterm and final. Assignment is also pretty straight forward. This is my favourite cs course.",
      "y tf does cfm requires this course? ",
      "10/10 course",
      "No you can't do the assignments the night before. Trust me I tried.",
      "Assignments could easily take up a whole weekend but they were fun to do. If you spent many hours looking at the slides and doing the assignments, you should have no problem with the final exam.",
      "Do the assignments and LEARN THE THEORY",
      "Assignments were pretty time consuming but material was interesting and exams were fair",
      "Don't use C++. I wrote the compiler in Scala and do not regret it.",
      "The last few assignments took a long time but other than that it was ok.",
      "Really interesting course that teaches the basics of how programming languages work, starting from the structure of a language, all the way to  memory management and linkers and loaders. The midterm was extremely long and almost no one finished it, with an average in the mid 50s. The final in contrast was quite easy and straightforward. Assignments can get very tedious, so make sure enough time is allocated (pun intended) for them. A great CS course overall.",
      "Fk the assignments, kevin lanctot slides op",
      "Content: A lot of theory, mixed with how to apply that theory to real world code. Learned a lot about compilers, assemblers, how computers work, and the theory of computing. Biggest downfall is the ordering of content. \n\nExams: The exam (there was only one this term) was very theory heavy, but a fair exam. Make sure you know how to study properly for this exam. Tips for studying include reviewing lecture notes, attempt to create questions based on the theory, and make study notes.\n\nAssignments: Assignments 1-5 were independent of each other, and covered the content from the week they were assigned. Don't take too much time so try and get them done as fast as possible. A3 and A4 were probably the hardest in the first half, but manageable if you review the lecture properly. Object Oriented mindset is a necessity. Assignments 6-10 were a series of assignments based on the previous assignment (or at least parts of it were). Make sure you complete the key questions in order to do well on the assignment. \n\nConclusion: Great course for learning the ins and outs of how to do OOP properly, as well as how a computer works. \n\nCourse Breakdown:\nPre-Corona\n25% Assignments\n25% Midterm (1)\n50% Final\n\nPost Corona\n30% A1-A7\n10% A8\n20% A9-A10\n40% Midterm\nBonus Essay for people failing ",
      "I think this course has a lot of great content, but the exams were unfair for my term. The assignments build off each other until you finish with a simple functioning compiler which is really awesome to see working! Unfortunately, the exams are 80% theory and your assignments will not help you that much. They throw ridiculous theoretical questions which they do not teach you at all how to approach them (e.g. make a grammar for this, is this fact about grammars true?). They also do not openly post exams answers (they apparently said have a limited supply of good questions). ",
      "(Disclaimer: taken online.) \nQuite an interesting course, discussing compilers and its various aspects including assembly and optimization. Not super in depth, but that's to be expected for an introduction. \nAssignments were fair and straightforward, as long as you followed the descriptions and examples in the course notes. The exams had a new format this term - 4 exams each covering a quarter of the course, with a mix of written and code questions. Not too hard either.\nGrading scheme: 10 assignments @ 6% each, 4 exams @ 10% each.",
      "Super interesting course if you pay attention to the content and keep up.",
      "Very interesting content. The course notes are the best I've seen so far - clear and easy to follow. The programming assignments can get really tedious, but in the end, you'll have a working compiler!",
      "Taken online. Overall a great course introducing you to assemblers and compilers. Gets a bit dry towards the middle with its DFAs, but lecture notes are fascinating and well-paced. Profs/ISAs are responsive and helpful. You get the choice between C++/Racket for assignments, which can be on the longer side, but are generally fair. Final mark was completely dependent on quizzes/assignments this term.",
      "This is definitely the most interesting and well-taught course at Waterloo that I've taken so far. Instructors and TAs are very responsive. Course notes are clear and well-written. The 10 assignments are on the lengthy side (and are probably harder/have more secret tests in online offerings), but they are pretty fair. Just make sure you start early. Took it online in Fall 2021, so there were only reading and concept quizzes, but no exams.",
      "If you want to make a compiler its useful, professors were fun but the assignments took a while for me",
      "Really interesting course. It cements your understanding of different algorithms and data structures. The reviews about the workload are real; this course personally took me way more time than CS246. They give an option for Racket but I don't know anyone in their right mind who would code using .... *that* over C++.",
      "I found this course interesting and the process of building a working compiler was rewarding. The course itself isn't too hard, but it can be very time-consuming as the assignments can take a long time to do.",
      "The delivery was 100% read the textbook on your own, and the textbook wasn't even that well written. Personally, the flipped classroom model was a complete failure for me as \"learning by reading\" is my worst learning method by far. The weekly in-person review lectures (with Dan Holtby) were also useless cause they cover nothing new (no new examples) and you're better off just reviewing your notes / the textbook for 15 minutes. Lastly, the assignments were tedious, boring, and unsatisfying as they all comprised of copy-pasting stuff from the textbook.  I had developed an interest in compilers & interpreters from CS146, but CS241 has really done a good job of killing my interest.",
      "Took in Winter 2022. The teaching style is flipped classroom where students are expected to read course notes on their own. There are optional weekly lectures but only for recaps. The course note was decent, but I digest contents slower when reading than listening. I wish the profs have lecture videos available on top of course notes like MATH 239. Assignments were quite tedious but fun to do. If you had a good habit of finishing the course note and finishing the assignments over a few days you should be fine. If you are like me and leave everything until the day before the due date then you will have a horrible time. Try your best to at least read the assignments as soon as they release.\n\nFor the course content, I really did not enjoy the section on Formal Language and Parsing. I know they are essential to building compilers but I did not find them interesting. I yawned every 5 minutes reading the notes on those sections. All other contents were interesting though, context-sensitive analysis (determine things like valid type, no duplicate variable names,...), code generation, linker loaders, and memory management were all very interesting. UWFlow ratings of this course are high with the majority liking it and saying it's great. But don't set your expectation too high. I went in thinking I would like this more than CS 136 and CS 246 but I was wrong. I still like it though but it's not that great to me.  ",
      "Pretty interesting stuff, I didn't think I would like the material in this course but after taking it, I might choose the follow-up courses as electives later on. Assignments were doable, midterm was fine. Post-midterm content seemed to be a bit more of how to implement certain functionalities, not really material well-suited to be on a final exam.",
      "Favorite course at UW, was run well with interesting content and fair assessments",
      "A lot of the assignments are more tedious than difficult. Once you figure out what to do, it's pretty simple. ",
      "A useful course for understanding how compilers are built but found the midterm quite challenging. Compilers just wasn't my thing, it's a hit or miss expereince",
      "Loved this course, the course modules given were super clear. Go to office hours!! The ISAs and IAs are very helpful. Took this in Winter 2022 with the flipped classroom style. This style is excellent for this course, I think it was very effective",
      "fav course, i wanna do compilers as a career now",
      "I did all of the assignments the day before and got good marks on all of them. So it's quite easy, although it's a lot of tedious coding. \n\nI personally enjoyed the assembly programming and compilation units more than the grammars/languages content, but pretty much all of the assignments were interesting and fun. ",
      "Took it in the first in-person term back from COVID. Reverse-learning format, you read course notes on Perusall and lectures are tutorial-style. In this course, you first learn MIPS assembler, then build a compiler for WLP4, a subset of C++ to MIPS, from scratch, adding a little each week. Scanner, parser, code generator, linker, dynamic memory management, all of that. Definitely changed my perspective on programming and 10/10 was a good learning opportunity. Start your assignments early, and know your binary to hex conversions. Writing a compiler from scratch without YACC/Bison/etc will change your life.",
      "Really enjoyed this course. Interesting content, extremely fair assessments, clear notes and helpful instructors. I found the pre-midterm content a lot more interesting than post-midterm, you'll learn things like grammars, parsing and code generation. Compilers used to be a black box to me but I now understand all the stages of them and how complex they truly are...",
      "The best second-year cs course. ",
      "The exam questions are really a matter of memorization since there are only so many ways they can ask different questions. Most of the early assignments can be done on auto-pilot but starting with assignment 6(building the wlp4 compiler) you need to understand how the pieces of the puzzle connect together.",
      "pass public/release tests, pass the course. Exams were fair.",
      "Best cs course alongside cs 246, earnt so much and even though we had weekly assignments, it was super fun completing them. Its kinda easy to get 100s on assignments if you understand material and go to office hours etc, be sure to start early as they are tedious. Prof Nomair lives up to the hype and is very amazing!",
      "Read the provided course notes properlyy and the assignments will solve themselves.",
      "Very easy to get 100% on the assignments. Many have already said but you literally just read the notes and you get the answers on how to solve it. The videos that Professor Richards had were really good too. Exams were fair and passable. Definitely the best course I've had so far in Uni. ",
      "Took this in Fall 2022. Incredible course, incredible prof, incredible course notes. Although I don't think I'm ever going to touch a compiler again, you get to really understand how programming languages actually work and get introduced to how code interacts with your computer's CPU and Memory. You also get some of your best programming experience yet (even better than CS246 tbh). The assignments were free 100%'s if you dedicated the time and followed the course notes. The midterm and final were fair, but do be warned that there can be some \"trickery\".",
      "Took it in winter 2022. Prob one of the easiest second year cs, had the easiest exam in my opinion. Had a compiler software engineer job after taking this course. Stuff you learn in this course is not really relatable with the actual compiler job. In fact, CS 251 is more relatable imo.",
      "Made me realize I'm not cut out for CS. Others love it.",
      "The first programming heavy course I didn't really like. I didn't hate it, and it is useful to understand assembly and language parsing, but it leads to much drier content compared to 246 or 136. Course staff is really solid, all assignments were fair if you're paying attention to content, and the midterm and final were pretty easy overall. Honestly a decent course, but the content was just not for me.",
      "Assignments were quite easy. For those considering the enriched offering, I knew someone who took CS 241E and from what I can tell it was much more difficult.",
      "fun course. assignment based learning. slides help you a lot with assignments. ",
      ":/",
      "The assignments are tedious, and more often than not, just read the module and then pass all the test cases.\n\nMidterm was easy enough.",
      "Definitely not the easiest second year CS course. I find all the grad courses I'm taking to be easier than this shit. Assignments are structured so that you basically die on the assignment if you couldn't finish the first problem. In summary, I'm high, you high, compiler high",
      "Unnecessarily boring and hard. It's very useful but I think it could be less difficult.",
      "A lot of coding. Learn parse trees well. MIPS is a pain in the ass to debug. Very interesting content though.",
      "boring and useless course\nliterally learned nothing useful that I did not already know",
      "Memorization based course. Assignments are very tedious, and hot take, the content is pretty dry. Profs are awesome and clearly care a lot about the course, but I just did not find it interesting at all.",
      "My favourite CS course so far. The content is very cohesive and it\u2019s interesting to see how the pieces fit together. The course notes + Kevin\u2019s slides are excellent and make the assignments much more manageable. Assignments did take a long time, but the satisfaction of completing your own compiler made it worth it.",
      "Personally, I thought it was really interesting. Understanding how compilers work is just good knowledge to have as a programmer. Assignments are time consuming but the profs give lots of structure and hints. Midterm and final were both really fair as long as you read all the modules. \n",
      "Assignments take some time but in the end you have a functioning compiler, I found it super cool to see it come together. Best course notes ever, just the right amount of detail without being vague.",
      "Really great course! Going from scanning to parsing of WLP4 (subset of C), and then making the code generation into MIPS really completes the idea of a Compiler. I got to write a lot of C++ with each assignment building off of the ideas in class and the previous ideas! Really liked the bonus optimization problem and how \"complete\" the course felt from start to finish. ",
      "I took this course in W23, and while the later assignments can be time sinks, the course notes and lectures are incredibly helpful and basically hold your hand the whole way through them. A slightly annoying aspect of this class was that multiple assignments would be available at a time, which was more just a psychological barrier, seeing that we had 3 assignments on our plate, even though they weren't all due at once. I also thought the last couple of modules seemed a little disorganized and rushed, but once again the clarity of the course notes prepared me more than enough for the final. Very fair assessments and overall great course staff. I found the more abstract content on DFAs, regular languages, etc. a little bit more enjoyable than more applied content such as linking/loading and memory management but I think that is just my preference. Advice for this course is to read the course notes before the lecture, start assignments early, and don't be afraid to ask for help early.",
      "It's a big time sink. You won't learn too many new concepts if you took CS 145/146.",
      "content was alright, I found that this course took up more time than cs246",
      "Enjoyed the first half of the course as early assignments and midterm were very fair, later assignments became much longer with questions depending on the completion of previous questions as well. Look through lecture slides for tips on how to complete assignments and watch the recorded videos to supplement the course notes.",
      "Everything except final is really fine and easy. However, I don't know why the final style appears to really CS246. The questions covered in final are somewhat \"you should know the concept really well otherwise earn 0 mark\". I have no idea how to perform well (90+) in the final. It feels like the final is designed to deduct at least 5 marks on your total mark.",
      "v fun course. seeing the entire compiler come to life through assignments is v fun to watch. overall well structured course. the course notes are amazing!",
      "This course is doable. Prof is very engaging. Although assignments take an extremely long time. Highly recommend taking this in a term when your course load is lighter.",
      "Assignments can be very time-consuming towards the end, and they all build on each other so it is critical you do not fall behind. You want to start far in advance. Overall, the course is interesting, but I can't say I enjoyed it particularly much.",
      "CS 146 has made me super excited about compilers and always looking forward to take CS 241 &  CS 444. THIS COURSE HAS RUINED EVERYTHING. Assignments take a decent amount of time. Getting a compiler written is rewarding, but the assignments are significantly disconnected from the exams. PROFESSORS SEEM SOMEWHAT IRRESPONSIBLE. Final exam seems to be a show-off of professors' intelligence(more like an IQ test covering lots of edge cases of course materials) instead of actually testing what we have learned, also there's an error in the final which made a question unsolvable. Bro plz be professional as a professor and review your exams before distributing them, Waterloo students are stressful enough",
      "The first time I actually have the motivation to write a comment on uwflow.\nExtremely time consuming with little reward. \nLearned basic compiler concepts in CS146, feels like my understanding on it has not gained at all after the entire term of actually \"learning\" it (probably besides parsing and linking). Even worse, it ruined my interest on compilers.\nAlso the prof gave me a feeling that he treats everything like a joke, which is the most irritating part to me.\nI can't guarantee that my comment is not biased, based on the fact that the final had an incorrect question and tbh other questions were not so good either.\nBut this course feels like a complete waste of my time, tuition fee, and passion. I personally recommend not taking it if you have a choice.",
      "Good shit. Fun assignments where you build a compiler. Sometimes takes a lot of debugging but satisfying when you get it. Super well run course, highly recommend (not that you have a choice probably).",
      "Very fun assignment, can be completed by using psedecode provided in the course note. The Course notes of CS 241 is super helper and they are main source of studying the course, make sure you understand every part to prepare for the test. The last 3 assignment is about writing a compiler for WLP4, not hard but you have to know \"tree\" well, how to build a parsetree, how to traverse, something like that. But the resource you need are all provided in the course note so you don't need to worry much about it. Believe me, professor Sylvie Davies is really an exellent professor, I like her PPT, really helpful and in detail. ",
      "The very fact that there was an impossible question on the final and that you LOST MARKS for not answering it should tell you enough about this course.",

Things do somewhat go off the rails with Peano Axioms and Program Verification. The main issue with this course - mainly just for this term (and potentially next term) - was the disorganization. The slides were quite long, and also quite dull in terms of explanations. Some had very few (useful) examples, and others had nothing but examples. The only \"lectures\" we had were a few short 2-5 minute videos about particular slides where they typically just went over the example on the slide, or maybe added in some additional information for said slide. I felt the course lacked effective explanations due to the medium for communication, which actually made our midterms and final somewhat difficult. The proofs in this course actually weren't all that bad, and to an extent I would argue were easier than Math 135. I guess it was because they were much more focused in terms of content, and not as abstract as 135. Just remember... YouTube is your friend!",

Although the section on Godel's Incompleteness Theorem did intrigued me enough to watched Veritasium's video on it, this course sometimes felt like a waste of time to me.",
      "I took this course only during the pandemic. It is poorly organized and the assignment and test questions are either very easy, or extremely difficult. This is defiantly a borderline Math course as 95% of the course revolves around proofs. Personally I dislike most of the contents taught in this course (the Turing machine part is a bit more interesting, but the assignment question is on a different scale compared to what was taught), but I think it is because of the way this course is taught. Each week there can be up to 200 or more slides to read and the lecture videos barely covers any contents. The course becomes boring and exhausting. This is the hardest CS course I have taken so far and I suggest taking it in person if possible.",

The content is taught poorly with a lack of examples and insights that truly reflect the difficulty and intuition present on the written assignments and assessments. The only way you're going to get a high grade in this course is if you let it become a time sink - allocating many hours per assignment, going to every office hour, and going to every tutorial. However, this course isn't even that relevant for many students pursuing a CS degree here. The fact this course needs to become a time sink if you want to do well is a testimony alone to not just how poorly taught this course is, but how poorly designed this course is.",

Students had to read between 100-150 slides from a powerpoint each week. Reading text from 100 uninteresting slides is just painful. \n\nI found the course difficult at first because the slides made the simplest concepts hard to understand. I already knew a few of the CS245 topics before this course and I still had a difficult time figuring out what the slides were trying to say. \n\nThe course got much easier after I gave up on the slides and started googling videos and articles to learn from instead. \n\nI did take this course during the pandemic, so hopefully it will be a little better in person.",
      "Surprisingly difficult course due to the style of delivery. Really sharp escalation in difficulty in assignments, and midterm was unexpectedly difficult. The proof methods used were a little hard to get used to, and the biweekly assignments actually took a while. Overall caught me by surprise for a course that was just supposed to be tedious. \n\nBig shoutout to prof. Roberts for having the best office hr and being patient despite some very very interruptive questions from certain students.",
      "This class is like you took MATH 135, and threw it in a blender, along with a bunch of other new concepts. A lot of the material presented seemed pretty interesting, however useless. Also, the first half of the course with propositional and first order logic was not too hard. However, everything after that was really hard to understand, like turing machines, and weird formal deduction proofs. Also, the instructors did not respond often to Piazza questions and gave very vauge answers oftentimes (usually just yes/no answers). I do have to give a shoutout to professor Kari, as her lectures and commentary were really fun and were honestly my main motivation for getting through this course. ",
      "Took it online and it was the worst course I've taken in my life. With 100+ poorly organized slides to read per week (alternatively, you could watch someone read off the slides word-by-word at 30 words per minute), the content delivery was abysmal. The content itself was sometimes interesting (particularly Turing Machines & program verification in Week 12/13) but brain-numbingly boring for the most part and insanely useless, which made the course 3 times harder (most people had 0 motivation for this useless course). The course staff were also just as useless as the content; Crowdmark assignments usually didn't have any feedback and  marks were deducted for no reason whatsoever. While Zihao Wang responded to each Piazza post very quickly, his answers were useless cause 99% of the time because he didn't care to understand the question and just wanted to type something in the instructor answer. In summary, this course was a huge waste of time and the delivery was terrible (course staff sucked). My one piece of advice is to study hard for the exams as they were very difficult timewise. Good luck. Update: You'll need the content in CS245 for CS251 and CS241 so make sure you're learning.",

Tutorials/Office hours can be very helpful if you go to the right person, some of them are literal bots, but others are extremely helpful like Pablo and Dheeraj. BUT THE EXAMS ARE SO HARD. The questions are similar to assignments but 10x harder and longer. Final tore me a new one.",

      "I had Jonathan Buss. Man put me to sleep in every lecture, no matter how hard I tried to pay attention. If you have Pablo's office hours, definitely attend them, they are so helpful for the assignments!! Pablo is the reason I passed this course, not Buss and his multitude of slides.",

I have not heard a single person say anything good about this course, but I'm going to go against the grain and say that the first half (formal logic) was pretty easy and interesting. The second half, though (turing machines and undecidability) made no sense. \n\nDon't see how this class is useful at all, though.",

Never posts anything unless we nag him many times, and is all over the place on Piazza. His notes are also really disorganized and all over the place.\n- Has policies (ie. -10% per day late) that the class does not know unless we ask him; students have to convey to other students policies over piazza as he does not announce them.\n- ignored all Piazza questions the week before the midterm, a lot of questions throughout the term and the period before the final.\n- Often does not provide helpful response at all on piazza, when he actually responds.\n- would often respond to items MONTHS later being like \"this is already released\"... yes it is now, but it was not at the time.\n- Disappears for days on end; ignoring our questions regarding when assignments will be released (on some occasions, he released assignments over a week later than he promised!).\n- told our class he would make typed notes or slides, took forever to do and only grabbed them from another professor, and only did it for a small subset of the course after repeated nagging.\n- Does not release practice solutions for midterm questions.\n- TA's don't provide helpful response either.\n- Makes assignments due after the formal lecture period (not permitted technically).\n- changed the syllabus halfway through the term (not permitted), was passive aggressive to students when responding to complaints about this. A grievance with the associate dean had to be filed to fix this.\n- Cancelled a lecture and promised a makeup video by the next day; took 4 days to post, and just grabbed an old one from YouTube.\n-Told us formal proofs were not on the exam, and then the day before told us it was. There was also great confusion to what was actually on the final exam.\n-Assignments are released over a month after they were due, A4 and A5 are not out, even after exams.\n-Students had to nag him repeatedly for the final exam formula sheet.\n- Repeatedly does not follow up on what he promised us; Unhelpful in general, source of great frustration.\n-Teaches us the same content as 245E despite not being a enriched offering.\n\n\nThe most important thing I learned about this course was how to crowdsource help outside of class in understanding fundamental course concepts due to the MIA prof, as well as how to learn concepts on my own. Anger management training was also embedded in the course due to how severely mismanaged it was.\n\n\nThe fellow students were great though, and helped me get through the course and understand fundamental course concepts.\n\nI initially enrolled in this course in a previous semester, and regret severely not finishing it\u2026 The course might be bad normally, but Shai took it to whole new shitness level.\n\nI feel bad for the people who had to take a INC to write a exam this semester, as what is taught this term is completely different from the previous terms.",
      "This course builds on what you learnt in MATH 135. The proofs and code verification are boring, but I liked the practical connections to real life that our prof talked about. Like, the potential consequences of not verifying your code, that was fun. Go to lectures and you'll be fine.",
      "Not super interesting. A lot of the content is review from MATH 135 (predicates, truth tables, etc), except that you delve deep into the basic theory which is quite boring and cumbersome.\nThe content was less interesting because it was taught by Shai-Ben David, see professor review.\nExams were hell and material grading was inconsistent, but this was also due to professor.",
      "Content taught is pretty interesting, also pretty free course, easy 90+.",
      "Pretty interesting stuff - kind of like MATH 135 but I liked this better, less proofs/inductions... Surprisingly I really enjoyed this even though I didn't do very well! SO MANY THANKS TO KRIS - he made the course content so clear and engaging I was shocked. Both midterm and final were fair, but I messed up the final because I kept making mistakes and spent way too much time mending it. ",
      "shit course",
      "Logic sucks.",
      "Content isn't actually that boring, but can feel boring during lectures. I think it's the way the lectures are structured that makes it really tough to stay focused. Perhaps shorter lectures, along with more visually appealing slides would help.",
      "You have to read Roberts' notes (constantly being rewritten), the official course slides, parts of the textbook, and attend lectures if you want to cover everything. Each one uses different notation, different names for theorems and different order of teaching. It makes this course way more work than it should be, on top of already being crammed with content near the end. The exams are reasonable, as are the assignments (except for one question so far this term). Hints are often given for assignments in the lectures. Questions on Piazza often go unanswered for days, and then are all suddenly answered in a single batch. "

In fact, before and up to assignment 2, the course is very trivial - don't let that fool you, because the course quickly becomes hectic as the workload exponentially increases and you will probably have to pull at least one all-nighter to keep up with the deadlines. The final project is fun if you and your group have a good sense of time management and absolute hell if you don't. If you're here, though, you probably have to take this course anyway, so just do it. If you put the time in you'll learn a lot.\n\nMidterm was absolutely brutal and filled with trivia, and the class average was actually under 50% when I took it.

No amount of skill from cs14x or AP java has saved me from this monkey grinding. Every meaningless hour I spend on these tedious assignments eats away at my soul.\n\nUsefulness: this is probably the most practical course I've taken thus far, and I've gotten pretty good with standard linux development tools. That said, it's not worth the time I had to put in (see above).\n\n... I'll go finish my assignment now",

      "This course is an easy course, in terms of content... for the most part. There are certain areas that may require multiple read-throughs to fully grasp the idea, but nothing you can't do. I did this course online due to COVID so it likely will be somewhat easier than its in-class counterpart. However, the areas I personally had an annoying time dealing with was our 5th assignment with the Visitor design pattern; and the final project where I had incorporated a massive number of design patterns which sort of increased the complexity since I had to figure out how to make them all fit together. The first 3 assignments were very straightforward and simple. The final 2 ramped up difficulty mainly due to debugging and memory leaks. The difficulty in this course lies with the insane amount of time you have to put in for each assignment. I found that for the 1st assignment, I spent about 6-7 hours on it. Assignment 2 and 3 had me spending about 10-12. Assignment 4 and 5 were between 17-20 hours. The sheer scale of the assignments as they progressed was the primary cause of increased time, the difficulty though didn't really scale all that much. I would advise caution for the final project, you will be better suited with either selecting a game that is done individually or choosing a group of 3. The individual games are meant to be done by a single person... the group games are not... nor should they be by 2 people (as I had). Somehow my partner and I finished our group game in a week and a half when it was meant to be done by 3 within 2 weeks. However, it significantly impacted our other exams, so I was highly advise against doing what I did. Otherwise, enjoy this course, it's really the only practical CS course I've had so far!",
      "Took it online during pandemic",
      "Do your assignments and you'll be fine. You'll probably be fine as long as you finish more than 2/3 of the assignments. For your final project, make sure to find groupmates that actually does work because I heard it can be really difficult otherwise. Also make sure you ask people early or else they'll agree to someone else haha (my groupmates were awesome!). There might be some contents from assignments that weren't covered in lectures, so do Ctrl + F on the reference materials (and Google is your bff!)",

It easily outshines any other course because it actually teaches you the most single important aspect of programming (and very fundamental too) - the OOP principles and design techniques. You will learn LOTS and the final project will be a great learning experience as well for those who haven't really done a side project outside of school. You will love this course! (I took AP CS and knew OOP already but still learn so many new stuff!)",
      "It definitely helps shift your mindset.",
      "Best course at UW so far. The content is expansive and perhaps this course  could even be divided into two so that there is more time to learn advanced design patterns and other concepts. \n\nThe assignments are easier than CS136 in terms of coming up with algorithms to solve a problem, but designing that very solution and its interface is where the real challenge of this course kicks in. Loved every bit of the assignments, and I felt they covered a lot of the fundamental learning objectives of the course. \n\nEverything about this course is perfect and enjoyable. +Rep",

      "My favorite class in 2A (taken alongside CS 245 and STAT 230). There are no formal assessments like midterm and exam. Instead, there are 5 assignments and one final project. The content builds on top of another so doing the assignments also helped me reinforce my knowledge. After completing the course and reviewing the contents just days ago, I can definitely say with confidence that I will use this knowledge in my upcoming co-op. This would probably be one of the most applied and relevant CS courses you will take. On another note, the instructors were super helpful on Piazza, especially Prof. Kierstead, which made me feel the instructors do care about the success of the students. Overall an extremely fun course to take, just try your best to stay on top of the material as it's pretty easy to fall behind since there's a lot of notes.",
      "One of the most useful course that I have taken. I am on my co-op work term and the contents learned in this course are proving to be very helpful. I can see how learning these contents can be extremely useful to other CS  jobs as well, especially the basics of Bash, C++, and UML diagrams. \nThe main challenge in this course is time management. The assignments (especially the final project) takes a lot of time, but very doable. Piazza questions are answered fast by professors as well, and office hours are provided throughout the week.",

      "By far my favorite course that I took in 2A. The content covered was extremely interesting and practical. You also learn C++ in this course which is super useful. In terms of assessments, there were only 5 assignments and 1 final project. I personally found the assignments to not really be too difficult at all. The difficulty of each assignment I would say was on par to your average CS135 or CS136 assignment. If anything, on average they were a tad bit easier and there are a lot less assignments compared to those courses. The final project was also not difficult, but just long and fairly time consuming. ",
      "Fall 2021 online semester consisted of 5 assignments, some quizzes, and a final project.

      "Was online so no way to understand the last two assignments. Generous curve though",
      "Good course. I learned a lot about C++ and how to design OOP programs. I came from advanced first year courses, so having no release tokens (a way to see the number of test cases you passed) made it much more difficult. Fortunately, the instructors encouraged testing and even gave us marks for making our own tests. \n\nTo be honest, the assignments weren't very interesting, but I still think they were useful. I found the quizzes easy since most of the questions I could just type in an editor and run some code to double check my answers. I took this course online, so all I had were assignments, quizzes, and a final project.\n\nI did the one-person project (I recommend choosing this if you just want to save time). It was pretty simple to do and can be implemented in one or two day if you create a good design.\n\nFor the more difficult assignments, I recommend starting right away as they can be hard to debug and implement. \n",

      "Great course to learn about OOP and Linux! Lots of content, 5 heavy programming assignments, midterm and final. Assignments are LONG but not too difficult if you start early and do bits each day. A4 was the hardest for me. You NEED to stay ontop of your stuff in this course.",
      "Definitely one of the most useful courses I've taken in undergrad, especially if you do any C++11 or newer for your coops. Covers many relevant C++ specific topics, such as virtual methods and how they work under the hood, the big five, RAII, some parts from the STL such as smart pointers, and other OOP concepts and C++ design patterns. ",
      "The assignments took me so long, it definitely wasn't easy. Definitely the hardest CS course I've taken yet. C++ kicked my butt. This course is quite important, so pay attention! I took it online in Spring 2021, there was a final project (no exam)",

Workload is really heavy, but the material is very useful and has lots of applications for co-op jobs. I honestly hated this course because of the workload and broad range of course content; the assignments were literally the most frustrating thing ever and took forever to crack. Final project was difficult  but still fun to do. Course content covered a lot of stuff, ranging from BASH scripts, to C++ syntax, classes, polymorphism, and smart pointers. Despite me not liking the course overall, the instructors/course staff were amazing and always willing to help. Office hours could be improved however, given the amount of people coming to them. Advice: DO NOT SLACK ON THE ASSIGNMENTS",

You'll learn OOP and C++, two of the most coveted skills for programming jobs (you used to learn Linux as well, but I pushed that part to CS 136L, which you hopefully enjoyed). At the end of the course there's a final group project. Make sure you get good groupmates who will put in their share of the work. There's also design stuff for this, which involves UML diagrams and a lot of writing. The way I sorted it with my groupmates was I'll do all the coding and they handle the writing. I'm a neat freak when it comes to coding and I'll document everything extensively and use constants etc, so I found it nice to look back and go \"cool, I wrote that in good style.\" Use only smart pointers for the whole course, and use CLion, it's debugger will save you at 3am.",
      "you learn c++. great. only problem is a lack of course notes, but prof was so good I didn't really need them. just get a good group for a5 and don't procrastinate on it or else you'll end up writing 3500 lines of code for a half functioning project. otherwise, pretty fun and cool course",
      "hard",
      "The lectures honestly felt very just 'oh here's a cool trick to solve this problem' repeatedly. It's cool that everything is automated with their assignments being on git and all, but sometimes when things are unclear the instructors will make note on Piazza but not change the assignment file itself. The midterm was pretty difficult for most people, but the final probably was a little bit better. The course would've probably been easier to digest if they shared the notes they were writing down, but overall the assignments were helpful in making sure your knowledge was solidified.",
      "a lot of coding, but sooo enjoyable. the final project is a grade booster and it's so nice to show off at the end. c++ is my fav language now.",
      "Probably the most important CS course you will ever take.",
      "the workload is heavy, really really heavy, especially toward the end. but teach you cool concepts and assignments are ace-able if you start early. the course doesn't have a course note which is... not logical. find a course note on the internet. always attend lectures, sometimes they teach you things beyond the course or some tips that will come up on the exams. exams were not hard if you knew the material. I think C++ is actually a really good fit for this course because of numerous things I won't go into detail about here. I did the final project on my own and got a 90. If you think you have the guts to do it alone, do it. because i belive the most problematic part of our teams was multiple people designed and shared their ideas about how we should do the project but on person ended up writing the code all by himself :). still, if you can do it on a team of people you know and who are hardworking.",
      "___Awfully___ organized with bad workload. C++ makes me feel bad about myself and my life every time I interact with it. ",
      "Horrible course design. It's super disorganized and all info is on piazza which is a shit hole to explore, no course notes so good luck if you missed a lecture, lectures are verbal and handwritten so good luck studying between your notes on one screen and VSCode on another. They don't even teach you to use VSCode they encourage Vim which is slow and clunky to use. Super heavy course load, although maybe the organization of the course contributed to that. That being said, TA's are a lifesaver and office hours will save your ass. Overall a really good course to take but you'll hate yourself for taking it every day.",
      "Move around between sections to find the prof that teaches you the best. Use previous year's slides if they don't provide them, as they have the exact same content. (Course is changing W23 a lot, so take people's advice with a grain of salt) ",
      "Course teaches really good concepts overall and content within C++. However course has no real course notes so going to lectures is really important. Assignments are reasonable if you start early enough and final project was actually fun with fairly straightforward marking scheme for the actual code portion. ",
      "Pretty heavy course, a lot of concepts are covered. Towards the end, there was definitely a rush to cover everything. Midterm was difficult, direct curve. Assignments can be heavy (esp the last one) and they usually have vague, long instructions, so make sure you clarify/read through carefully. They're removing bash and linux, so hopefully it makes the C++ and OOP content more in-depth. Overall, the course is useful, but somewhat disorganized.",
      "Probably the most useful course you will take up until 2A. Pretty much 4 assignments + final project, then your standard midterm and exam. The assignments were very possible to get 100 in if you started early and wrote good tests. Like 30% of your mark on all assignments is just test cases, so make sure you write good ones. The final project was pretty fun, and the grading was very lenient (average of 96 for the course). Midterms and exams were hard but as long as you can do the assignments on your own, you will be fine!",

      "For the final- MEMORIZE THE DESIGN PATTERNS. I played myself thinking there's no way we'd be ask to implement entire design patterns... we were asked to implement three. So make sure that you thoroughly understand the usage and implementation of literally every design pattern you learn for the final.",
      "One of the most useful CS courses, you learn about useful stuff like Bash and Linux and Regex in the first part (which is getting moved to 136L), and then it gives you a pretty good overview of C++ OOP and design patterns. Profs clearly cared a lot, and while the workload could be a bit heavy at times (although not as bad as they warned about), getting good marks was pretty easy if you tried. Midterm was rough but the easy final and lenient final project grading made up for it. Pick a good group for the project, and find some course notes online since they don't post any.",
      "w course",
      "Most useful CS course by far. You will be introduced to and get very familiar with C++ (maybe a bit more than you'd like lol), and learn various design patterns. Midterm is rough but the final lets you make up for it. Profs are extremely helpful, make use of office hours if you must. There are no course notes, but you should be attending lectures anyway since the profs are pretty good. Assignments can get a bit tough, and the final project can be extremely fun or a nightmare based on how you make of it.",
      "This is a difficult, but important course for CS students. OOP is a fundamental skill in the industry. The final project will be useful for your own knowledge and project portfolio. \nPay attention to the lectures.  They are very fast-paced and you may find yourself quickly lost if you don't review the past content before a lecture.\nStudying for exams is hard (midterm average was like 57). No lecture slides are posted. You must review your notes and come up with your own practice problems. If I were to redo this course, I would go to tutorials to look at concrete examples of design patterns, iterators, polymorphism, etc.\nAssignments are tough, so start early. The piazza for this course is fairly good - responses are quick. However, I got ghosted by the profs a couple of times. Maybe they thought my questions were obvious or had been addressed in tutorials. Go to office hours if absolutely stuck. There are probably other students there who will help you.\nI came into the course with no prior knowledge of OOP, which made it very difficult. I was surprised to see that I passed by a good margin. Glad I took the course though!",
      "Go to the lectures, especially don't ignore the tutorials, TAs this term (F22) were absolutely GOATed.",
      "Midterm was really tough, but the profs graded the final project and final exam lightly. Only problem was really the lack of course notes, but the tutorials were really helpful.",
      "really hard if you don't know what you're doing, probably easy if you know what you're doing. final project goes hard (mark boost), midterm is rough, but the final exam is alright.",
      "This course forces you to really understand what is happening under the hood of a programming language, and requires a serious time investment. The latter half of the course required tons of time and the midterm was quite difficult. This being said, both the final project and the final exam were marked pretty easily. Take this with a grain of salt, as I think they're changing the structure of the course next year.",
      "Even though OOP is useful, the Bash stuff we learned was still the most useful thing. That's being moved to 136L though. This course was really interesting and fun but incredibly frustrating. The assignments are split over 2 weeks where you write test cases and UML stuff for week 1 and actually code for week 2. It really helps you see how useful tests are especially when they're already written when you need them. Midterm/final have a knowledge portion where you need to be able to explain why things are the way they are. The rest is coding on paper which isn't super horrible. Start all your assignments really early or you'll regret it. Learn how to use git and start the final project the minute you get it. You'll put every other class aside and spend 50 hours a week on it but it's so cool! They never posted lecture notes or even tl;dr on what was covered which is really shit so go to class and make sure your friends are there when you're sick.",
      "Took online F21. Pretty good introduction to OOP and C++ (which is really important considering so many other UW CS courses use C++). Memory management and debugging was a pain but a good precedent for what upper year courses are like. Assignments were similar in difficulty to 136, but a bit trickier, final project was relatively easy but fun.",
      "This course is good.",
      "It was so hard during Covid ughhhh online 246 was baaaaaadddddd. Also, take it with a nice prof. You'll thank yourself. Select prof carefully.",
      "This course was the highlight of my 2A term, the final project - while a lot of work - was incredibly fun to work on and I actually got to use the content presented in class, like design patterns to make previously very difficult implementations easy.",
      "Lectures are mandatory, as notes are not posted. (However, there are notes from previous terms online.)\nMidterm was very long (20+ pgs).\nA4 and A5 were difficult and required many hours, but it was satisfying to create your own working game.",
      "Transitioning from C to C++ was like exploring a whole new ocean coming from a sea. Although some syntax did translate, the new content of OOP was very heavy. If you missed a lecture, you'd most likely be lost. I would say the assignments are the toughest part of the course. The midterm and final was fine if you attended tutorials (Final Exam Review by Tabitha was very helpful). Be sure to find a good partner for the project. Besides that, I would really recommend Ross Evans, he goes through the content thoroughly and explains well.",
      "Very useful course, but it is also difficult and a lot of work. You have to stay on top of lectures and assignments not to get lost. I almost failed this course because I wasn't doing good on the assignments. The final group project was actually very interesting. Looking back, I have learned SO much about OOP, stuff like constructors, destructors, inheritance, etc.",
      "All the tools needed to write programs with strong object-oriented design. You learn many concepts and tools you will use abundantly beyond this course. Assignments can take some time but aren't too difficult. People lost lots of marks on the midterm. The project is fun.",
      "+1 Caroline Kierstead, got 90 overall",
      "Assignments took a lot of time, final project was in groups so make sure to plan ahead and try to find a group early. ",
      "Presented all you need to build a strong foundation for OOP. Lectures given by Brad were really engaging and clear. Assignments are challenging and time-consuming but really help integrate everything learned in class together. Midterm was a disaster with a 50-ish average, final became much easier after you've spent enough time with C++ and everything really came together. ",
      "The only drawback of this course is everything is written on blackboard and course notes are never posted. Otherwise, covers everything you need to know about OOP, a must for industry jobs. C++ is used, once you master it, other languages definietely become easier to learn compared to C++. The midterm wasn't the best, average was 59, but the project and final are the lifesavers tho.",

      "godly material but i also died",
      "You learn a lot of very interesting and useful stuff in this course. Loved the problem-centric + discovery style delivery of the content, made it that much more engaging and definitely helped me learn. Assignments were quite long but very rewarding - beware there's no release tests so you'll have to write your own tests!

Final project was very time consuming but I think they were somewhat generous in their marking. Assignment problems were often unclear in their intent, but usually following standard implementations gives the intended solution.",
      "Waste of time. Learned few things particularly useful, of which most were not well explained. \n\nThe midterm was full of C++ trivia questions or about and asked to implement things without providing adequate reference material. Prof was too lazy to write course notes. \n\nStupid secret tests on assignments. We also had to write our own tests, which of course also has secret tests, making this course not ace-able if you want to go outside. Assignments are mostly very long, tedious, boring, unthoughtful and horrendously explained. The assignments in this course remind me why communication courses are mandatory for CS students, which of course includes the TAs. For example, we were instructed to write a function where the return type was not specified. \n\nOverall, again, a waste of time.",

      "As advertised, this is a course in Object-Oriented Development and design -- you'll learn design patterns, good use of abstraction and encapsulation, coupling vs. cohesion, and so on.  It is also a course in the esoteric corners of C++, 'cause why not.  Code in lecture will be optimized using strange techniques that only C++ could possibly have any use for (and that's not even counting the templates).  Luckily, assignments (mostly) do not require this level of optimization.\n\nAssignments were moderately difficult (although horribly written and requiring numerous clarifications).  The midterm was tricky, since it tested detailed C++ knowledge (design isn't covered much before the midterm).  The final project this term was building a game engine, which is great fun -- but make sure to start early because it will eat up your time!\n\nOverall if you look past the C++, this is a solid, useful course.",
      "Lots of secret tests. Your assignments will be assessed on design, style, and test case coverage, not just correctness. Hard midterm. Extremely time consuming final project. (Extremely, extremely time consuming. I need to emphasize that.) Content is pretty dry and annoying to learn. Lushman is not necessarily the most enthusiastic lecturer but he is clear and I don't think there's really a better style of teaching for this type of content. I\u2019m almost certain our offering was curved.\n\nI will say that the course content has taught me a lot of useful stuff about C++.",

The pacing of the course is fast, and I wished that we spent more time applying certain ideas of topics (design patterns, more general kinds of abstractions, ...). I think there was too much breadth in the course, making it a bit difficult to fully understanding some of the later topics discussed (template metaprogramming tricks, allocators, ...). Personally think I would have enjoyed this course a lot more if it were taught in Java (sorry Lushman), but the assignments and content still make this my favourite course in undergrad so far. ",

I compared my executable to the sample executable they give to test your output against and my executable had half of the memory leaks. But you won't know that you'll failed secret tests until after the deadline because they don't even give you release tokens.\n\nThe spec they give you for assignments is verbose, unclear and full of holes. You'll read literally 6 pages and still not know what to do. And then you'll have to read every post on Piazza just to have something small cleared up.

Even though the first half is easy, make sure you know the content well. Starts with intro to ARM, moves on to logic gates and transistors, building up to low level circuits. Second half is Single Cycle Processors, Pipelined Processors, and Virtual Memory. \n\nExams: Only had 1 this term due to COVID, but it was quite similar to the assignments. Doing the practice problems at the end of the assignments should prepare you thoroughly. \n\nAssignments: Simple assignments. Each one should take you no more than 2 hours to complete, and a lot of the content is in the slides.\n\nCourse Breakdown\nPre-Corona:\n5% Clickers\n15% Assignments + 1% Bonus\n25% Midterm\n60% Final\n\nPost Corona:\n5% Clicker\nA1 2%\nA2 3%\nA3 12%\nA4 15%\nA5 20%\nA6 23%\nMidterm 20%\nCredit/No Credit by Default\n45%+ A3-A6",
      "Worst course this term, did not transfer to online well. The content should theoretically be interesting, but the presentation was so incredibly boring and disorganized. \nLectures were mostly unedited hours-long (yes, plural hourS) videos with a prof going through the slides which look like they were made by a 5th grader. The videos improved as the term went on, but too little too late IMO. \nAssignments at least were relatively easy, and exams/quizzes were all done on Learn, mostly multiple choice/multi select. Nothing remarkable about the grading for the online term - 35% assignments, 25% quizzes, 25% midterms (15% first, 10% second), 15% final.",
      "Although i wasnt really able to grasp the beginning concepts regarding transistors, i found the latter parts of the course really interesting. Content is helpful for some 241 (assembly and mips/arm) and 245 (245 did not introduce finite state machines well before going into turing machines) concepts ",
      "The online 251 materials are really messy, not organized for me and my classmates. I usually watched the video many times but still could not often get the point, especially in week 10 and 11 (this not just happened on me). I had to accept the low efficiency when study 251 and it's not a wise use of the time. The term tests did not provide enough time to finish and many multiple choices were like the wording games or something we even have not seen.  Previously I heard that 251 is the easiest course in 2nd-year CS, however, to be honest, as a person with 96% in cs246, I cannot ensure getting over 80% in 251 even I always study hard, such a ridiculous and disappointed fact.",
      "The most boring course ever. Content is easy but very hard to stay focused when I would rather watch paint try. Profs are helpful, tho.",
      "Really well-organized online, with high-quality lectures.",
      "The content was easy in my opinion, but not taught as well as other CS courses (disclaimer: took it online).",
      "Took this during work term and I had no trouble completing the quizzes and assignments on time. The course material is pretty easy, the part on datapath hazard can be somewhat tricky but overall definitely not as tough as some other CS courses I took like 245. The content can be useful for programming and probably for courses like CS 241 and CS 350. The exam (aka Term Test 2 since it only covers the second half of the course in my offering at least) was not much harder than the midterm (Term Test 1). Prof Mann's videos explained concepts better than the textbook sometimes but unfortunately, textbook reading is required so the videos were mostly examples and assumed you have read the textbook sections. I would prefer more videos but that's just my personal preference.",
      "good stuff to know for SWE interviews, and just debugging your build tools / computer in general",
      "Interesting course for those interested in computer hardware and how it works at that level, some knowledge from this is useful for operating systems and whatnot... this course is on the significantly easier side as compared to other CS courses and enjoyable in that sense too",
      "If you want to do hardware this is useful, but the lectures were boring and the material is hard",
      "My least favourite CS class so far.",
      "This course isn't very hard, but some things can take a bit to understand. Assignments are usually very straightforward from the lectures and the exams were similar to assignments. Although the course is not very interesting in my opinion.",
      "The first half of the course was very easy but kinda boring (to be fair, the first half was online for me). After the midterm, the datapath stuff was more challenging but very interesting. The assignments and exams were extremely fair and easy. MAKE SURE YOU ATTEND CLASS. There are tons of long, intricate, involved, in-class-only examples that do a really good job of illustrating otherwise complicated concepts. As long as you attend every class, this course is bird (only spend 2 hours outside of class per week). ***This only applies to Stephen Mann's sections - I heard everyone with Valerie Platsko hated their life.",
      "Took it with Rosina in Spring 2021 (online). Rosina and the ISA (I forgot her name) were both very kind and helpful. I enjoyed the course! The midterm and final were challenging, but the quizzes and assignments were quite reasonable. ",
      "Very annoying homework.",
      "The assignments were super easy and the content on its own was reasonably interesting, but my goodness the lectures were so horribly disorganized. I never had any fucking clue what was going on in class, and I basically learned all of the content by doing the assignments. The assigned textbook readings also made no sense and had dozens of errors. They also made us buy iClickers...\n\nDefinitely wouldn't take again. The profs seemed nice enough - I don't know what happened.",
      "Took the course in-person in Winter 2022. The required in-person components were an absolute waste of time. The lectures were incredibly unengaging and the course slides were borderline useless because most of the information was omitted so that we would have to attend lectures. I usually slept or did other classwork during lectures. To do the assignments, me and a couple friends would cram the textbook the day before the assignment was due and then figure out the assignment together right before it's due. ",
      "You get to learn CPU architecture and how computers work. In all your CS required courses this one has the most hardware. Lectures can be terrible (but not the prof's fault, since she didn't write the slides). I went to Valerie's office hours and she re-taught me all of the material 1-on-1, and I ended up learning a lot + doing pretty well. Taking this together with CS 241 may result in you mixing up ARM/MIPS assembler details, since this is an ARM course and 241 uses MIPS. Be careful about that.",
      "Feel like it could be easy except there were no notes the whole ass term. Really hard to study for a course without a source of truth for the material. Personally think lectures barely went over core concepts and were more of extended tangents. Learned more from YouTube videos than classes and am fucked for cs350. ",
      "Was pretty cool learning how computers actually function. First half of the course is very easy covering digital gates, flip-flops and single cycle processors. Definitely gets harder in the second half with multicycle processors, pipelining and virtual memory. Exam questions are very similar to assignments and tutorials.",
      "Not as bird as expected. Midterm and final were curved so ended up doing well",
      "Not nearly as bird as expected but still a lighter CS course. I think the professors also made the course harder than intended as both the midterm and the final were curved. Professor Li was a nice guy but his lectures were atrocious unfortunately so I had to rely on Maran Ma's videos to learn the content. Boring course but not too hard",
      "Not sure what I learned.",
      "Among the other 2XX courses, this is probably the easiest since it's literally staring at diagrams until you understand how the different components of a computer interact with each other. Also, having a course on hardware was a breath of fresh air from the math/coding-heavy courses we take as cs majors.",
      "can get hard if you dont read the material properly. But concepts are pretty easy. Assignments were easy af and exams were fair",
      "The notes for this course are pretty useless without the lectures. Clicker questions are annoying because I forgot my clicker a lot of the time. Assignments and exams are all pretty easy.",
      "have no idea what is going on in lectures but surprisingly i can do the assignments ",
      "Not as useful, unless you want to go into low level stuff. If you can do the assignments on your own, or at least understand the solutions 95% you'll be fine for the midterm + exam.",
      "This is one of the easier 2XX CS courses you can take, assignments come directly from tutorials and lecture slides while exams come almost directly from assignments. Listen in class and keep up with assignments and you won't have much else to study",
      "Took this during Fall 2022. It's a relatively easy course that teaches you the more hardware side of computer science in preparation for cs350. However, it was made more difficult than it should have been because of the horrible course notes (someone please rewrite the entire thing holy f*** - the prof's supplementary slides saved me)",
      "Took it in winter 2022, not content heavy. Had a compiler software engineering co-op right after this term and I think this course gives you a good idea of some of the commonly used hardwares. ",
      "don't worry if you can't understand the content. just memorize tutorials and assignment problems and it should be a free 80+.",
      "pretty birdy course for a required CS major course. Just do the assignments and watch the lectures.",
      "The first CS course that covers hardware significantly. Pretty interesting content to know (not sure how much it helps in the actual field) but fully understanding it isn't even required to pass the course. If you pay even a little bit of attention in lectures, assessments aren't too bad.",
      "Laid the foundations for basic digital hardware stuff for me. Loved the course honestly. I got a good prof. Pay a lil bit of attention and you'll do really well. ",
      "Went into this course with minimal hardware knowledge, but still found the content straightforward. Post-midterm content got more complex, but assignments do a very good job of preparing students for exams. Final was on the long side (32 pgs).",
      "Interesting course. Probably easiest CS course in terms of effort needed to pass tho I did find post midterm content a bit confusing near the end",
      "First half is easy. Midterm average is historically over 0\n80. THAT SAID IT GETS HARD IN THE SECOND HALF. ",
      "I enjoyed learning about hardware and found the content interesting. Very easy in the first half, definitely got a lot harder after the midterm. Exams were pretty long, but similar to the assignments.",
      "Needs some practice but it's nowhere as technical as other cs courses. Content is interesting, goes into the right amount of detail. Just practice till you've memorized all the different types of questions.",
      "pretty lame course ngl. No coding, just very low-level stuff working with 1s and 0s and understanding how a single cycle/pipelined datapath works. W23 midterm was easy final was so hard.",
      "Probably lightest workload out of CS2XX courses, only 6 written assignments aside from midterm and final, with some of the assignments being very short (and a lot of questions can be found solved in tutorials/labs). The course is also one of the easier ones out of CS2XX courses, but I found CS246 easier as this course has almost no coding and has some trivia like questions. Midterm was very fair (review past midterms from math exam bank), final was kind of long but still very doable.",
      "Trivial stuff on hardware. Content get complex after midterm but overall easy (with mark hard to go 95+). The final is weird, finished everything but still get 10 marks deducted and heard that many students not even finish the final.",
      "Underrated course in my opinion. You start by learning an assembly language and then the rest of the course is how you would create the architecture that would execute those assembly instructions, and how it interacts with memory, cache, etc. Pretty cool stuff",
      "Easy course, I recommend everyone taking the course needs to know the stuff deeply rather than knowing how to do assignments only to prepare for the final.",
      "course was fine, Zille is a great prof, however clickers were run extremely poorly. Clickers were worth 5%, but each lecture would have a different number of clickers and they were not evenly spread out over the classes, for example my section went without clickers for over 2 weeks where as my friend had clickers multiple times that 2 week period. Suffice to say that if you want to get all the clickers get a good section or just show up to every single lecture without fail.",
      "It's a course that demystify your computer: it's not a black box anymore. You will know how everything is built up from simple transistors with layers and layers of abstraction. The first half is very easy. Then there is datapath, pipelining, caching and vm, which are a bit harder but also more interesting.\n\nThe textbook is ass. The content can be long and boring. But Stephen Mann makes it clear and chill, and I feel I learned a lot of new things. He is an interesting guy. You know this guy knows what he is doing because he drinks coca cola from a cup with a straw. \n\nThe isa Jack Zou is also very nice and helpful. The exams and assignments are not tricky.",
      "Poorly run course overall imo. Some of the content is kinda interesting. Assignments are super easy and worth very little, and the exam was kinda fucked. Loses points in my book for having iClickers worth 5%",

This term (Spring 2022) no cheat sheet is allowed, and test questions are mainly based on detailed memories. Do not even try to argue with me that the exam is \"for the understanding of knowledge\", because it is literally testing memorizing only.\nWhat is more disgusting is that there are bootlicker students who will jump to attack you if anyone tries to raise the question.

      "Could be boring if you are not very interested in learing information systems. The course only talks about the concepts and you just need to momerize them. You would learn a tiny bit of SQL and relational database in between.

      "Taught me a good amount about how databases are designed and to a lesser degree implemented. Good review of SQL and in general quite easy.\n\nTaken online, grade inflation mostly just affected the final, but not so much everything else since they required more problem solving/less knowledge",

      "The course is useful, but the content can be pretty dry and boring. Assignments are way more difficult than the exams in my opinion, as the assignments are designed to be learning tools rather than assessment tools. Overall if you have a solid background in databases, algebra, and SQL you will be fine.",
      "the reviews are fake!!!!!!!!!",
      "Very useful course overall. Prof (Michael Liu) gives practice problems during lecture so don't miss his lecture if possible. My personal opinion, Relational Algebra and ER Diagram are somewhat harder than other topics (require more time/practice to do well).",
      "Basically a SQL course, could be hard when you just getting started, but much easier when you are familiar it.",

Online recorded lectures and in person lectures repeated each other even though students were told to watch the videos before coming to class. Assignments and midterms were very easy and there were opportunities for bonus marks as well. Final exam was all multiple choice but open book and was a little tricky just because of the wording of some questions, but still not terrible. If you are an experienced CS student you would likely find this boring but if you want to learn a really useful side of CS that you haven't touched before, it is a good course. ",

      "This course was great! Almost everything you learn is very applicable. Relational algebra is probably the least important thing you learn about and it's easy. You learn SQL queries and how to create, edit, and delete tables, constraints, and triggers. You learn about how to design and improve existing databases. It's perfect for someone trying to do projects that require lots of stored information. The 4 assignments were very manageable, midterms were medium. Just a great course",
      "Boring course, came into this course thinking I was gonna learn more about SQL but ended up looking at high school notes the whole time; instead got fed a bunch of miscellaneous facts that aren't too interesting; exam was screwed since it was all multiple choice with only 24 questions",
      "I found the prof's presentation of course material lacked clarity and organization. The final exams were particularly challenging, seeming at times unrepresentative of the content covered throughout the term. Additionally, the criteria for participation grading often felt subjective and unfair, disadvantaging some students.

The upside is that it's a really basic intro course to SQL. You could easily learn everything on your own in a few days. The workload is quite light. However the final is horrible, with 40% of grade allocated to 24 questions. Median and mean are around 55. Truly a memorable class that ends with students collectively filing grievances. ",

The assignments and midterm exam are fair, while the final exam posed more challenges (finally got curve up). However, dedicating two weeks to review lecture notes would lead to a decent score. Despite being surprised by the bonus marks as a non-participant, overall, the professor is a good person. She responds to questions promptly and provides helpful explanations.",

      "Great course/content, assignments can be tough.",
      "Start early on the assignments!",
      "A very useful course for interviews (the first half at least). It shows you how to construct algorithms to deal with some graph theory probs from math239, and it expands a little on stuff learned from cs 240 (although it's mostly new content).  The 2nd half is a lot more theoretical and things get pretty complex at NP Completeness. \n\nThe assignments are a little on the tough side. They are mostly written (we had 2 programming questions out of all the assignments). All in all a very interesting and enjoyable course.",
      "Find things to supplement the book and the assignments. The exams are killer.",
      "Standard undergraduate algorithms course.",
      "Again, another course that is SUPER USEFUL! Pay attention to it as much as possible. These topics come up on almost 99% of the interviews you will have.",
      "It's a useful course, but chances are you'll probably hate it. Material is tricky, but content is divided into somewhat different modules, so chances are you'll find something that's alright. When I took it, it was generally poorly managed. Marks for last 2 assignments were given post-final, so we didn't have any feedback on that (one of these assignments was due more than a month ago). There were like 7 TAs so I'm not sure how it can be that difficult. ",
      "Stay on top of it!",
      "I heard the concept is really useful when you are doing interviews. I did not go through interviews last term, so I could not say much about it. The course overall I found out it is hard in the end of the term. Good luck! ",
      "This was a good course, even though the final exam was incredibly difficult.",
      "Tricky at times, but useful and interesting",
      "Difficult assignments and concepts, but pretty useful.",
      "Interesting course, but course materials are somewhat challenging",
      "So useful for job interviews.",
      "I can see it's super useful. But maybe I'm just not good at algorithms / not smart enough. I find it very, very challenging and just hope I could pass. Assignments are tough for me and I didn't finish the midterm or final exam. Good luck with that.",
      "Dynamic programming and some of the graph algorithms were pretty difficult. But overall, all of the algorithms are interesting.",
      "This course is way too easy. Why isn't there an advanced/enriched version/section of this course? Even CS246 has an enriched CS246E now.",
      "Overall very difficult, but covers some interesting concepts.",
      "Used for almost all CS problems AND helps a bunch with interview prep",
      "The courses gives a rigorous treatment to algorithms. It introduces many types of problems (like the ones in the description) and the focus will be on learning the frameworks to approach the problems, as well as proving that a given solution is correct. It gets very logic and math heavy. I don't think it will be immediately useful for doing interview questions, but you will learn to see algorithms from a theoretical perspective, and it was very eye-opening. Assignments could get hard, taking 15 hours, and midterm/exam were pretty monstrous (but they gave us 10 buffer marks)",
      "Study for this. Very useful for interviews.",
      "Teaches you how to solve 90% of tough interview problems and is just plain fantastic.",
      "Changed to weekly assignments so it's easier to catch up.",
      "Assignments are both challenging and very fun. Exams are somewhat brutal but it is totally within the scope if you manage to contribute enough time to study. My opinion it is much more useful and enjoyable than CS240 as it helps you develop problem-solving skills instead of memorizing pseudocode of someone else's algorithm.",
      "Expect this class to be overfilled at the start of the term with not enough seats for everyone, but things will improve by the cutoff date as the weak get culled.",
      "Most useful course in CS undergrad. Assignments were hard (but heavily weighted, 36%! yay!) but forced you to apply what you learned in class. Loved it.",
      "I wanted to like this course. I really did. It had everything a course I would like could have. Math, algorithms, interesting problems, new ideas. Except it didn't, at all. This course is the most disappointing course I've taken in Waterloo so far. At best, it could be described as a confused amalgamation of graph theory, theoretical computing, and algorithms for useless problems. At worst, it's four month of my life I will never get back. I left 240 knowing so much more about how to approach and tackle problems, with incredible amounts of information which is crucial to my understand of algorithms. I left 341 with nothing but the definition of the word dynamic programming.  There is no way to avoid taking this course, but I sincerely hope that the course is better, because I truly pity anybody who had to take this course as I took it.\n\nI received an 83% in this course. I took it under professor Lubiw, who was thoroughly OK. The assignments were fair, but occasionally bordered on unfair. The midterm was relatively fair, but the final was specifically written to knock the average down, with a CURVED average of 61%.",
      "It was actually pretty EZ",
      "Took this as an elective... It honestly wasn't that hard. The graph theory stuff was interesting!!",
      "This course feels like a successor to CS240, and focuses on applying different types of problem solving strategies (e.g. divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic). The concepts are not conceptually challenging (except for maybe NP-completeness towards the end of the course), but the questions can get pretty tricky. Would recommend lots of practice.",
      "Fuck this course",
      "follow along, dont leave till last minute",
      "The course is extremely interesting and applicable to coding questions seen in many interviews. I personally really enjoyed how it helps to think of problems in different ways and gives the tools to solve with a better approach. The concepts can get hard to grasp at times so make sure to fully understand them.",
      "Content was really interesting, but I was hoping for a bit more from this course. The treatment was rigorous enough, but, just like CS 240, I felt like the course was going too slowly. A lot of students already know most of the first half of this course I think (divide & conquer, DP, greedy) so I feel like the pace of the course can be a bit quicker.",
      "The most useful CS I've ever taken..... Both useful for academic and interview. Be sure not to miss anything!",
      "Very fun course. It seems like there are two different offerings of CS341. Aptitude for the course seemed pretty bimodal - some folks would look at a problem and it would immediately click, others would eventually stumble on a good enough solution and call it a day. If you have a competitive programming background, have no fear.",
      "I keep questioning my IQ taking this course. ",
      "It really is the leetcode of courses. You learn different algorithm paradigms and NP Completeness. Assignments were tough but manageable, including programming assignments. Quizzes were awesome for checking your learning, and final was tough but again doable. I wish they made it a little easier because it was like a really long assignment which we only got 48 hours, whereas assignments we got a week. ",
      "Trevor is insanely good. Anna is okay.",
      "Very interesting course, very useful as well too, very math heavy as well too... highly recommend understanding the mathematics behind each of the algorithms, looking into how to write proofs in a proper manner for CS courses... this course definitely took some time to do, we were able to code in both C++ and Python, just choose Python way better ",
      "Content is obviously useful, but course was not well structured and content not super well taught. ",
      "When I took this course, it was pretty much all online. Lecture videos were uploaded on YouTube and there were weekly assignments covering the material taught in the previous week. I like that they were generally quite short but dense because a 30 minute video every few days is less intimidating than a 2 hour video at the same intervals.\n\nThe weekly assignments helped keep me on track with the material, such that when the exam rolled around it was basically just revision and practice. I also like that the assignments were all problem-solving. They were often seemingly tough and scary but working through them slowly (with LOTS of help from office hours) was where most of the learning happened for me. In contrast, I had a friend in a different university whose algorithms course was testing how well you remember stuff from the lectures, and most assessments were MCQ. What's an algo class where you don't have to write lots of algos and prove correctness? Sure, it's easier but my friend said he would have preferred the format here.\n\nThe exam was quite doable if you understood the material fairly well. The questions tested understanding of the major algorithm design strategies, and of reductions; not a lot of memorization needed if you did all the assignments and/or read and understood the answers. That said, there was one question worth 5/50 points that asked us to use algorithms (and know their runtimes) given in lecture to solve a problem. Not my favorite kind of question but it's reasonable I guess.\n\nOverall, I liked the format and difficulty of the class.\n(Note that I'm used to all-online formats)",
      "Pretty fun and interesting course on algorithms. Found it easier than CS240 for some reason.",
      "Leetcode: the course",
      "This is a very useful course for learning about all types of algorithms, no doubt useful for tech interviews and grinding leetcode. Assignments are problem-based and involve applying algorithm knowledge from lectures",
      "If you understand all the algorithms they teach in class you should be fine for any exam, if you don't then coming up with solutions on tests will be difficult since they were usually just the lecture algorithms with deviations.",
      "Found it decently more challenging than 350,  first half of the course was def leetcode heavy, if you can solve dp, greedy, d&c mediums then should be more or less doable (assuming you understand how to prove shit), proofs were not too bad tho, just understand the general pattern and you should be good. Midterm had a some short questions, one on a recurrence tree, and then 3 questions on dp, greedy, d&c. All were similar to algs discussed in either previous assignments, tutorials, or class. Assignments were kinda time consuming, start early such that you get an idea of the question, what its asking so that you can think about it and come up with a solution in time. Also, they didnt give a lot of extra practice problems and stuff but i found things like the stanford algorithms course super helpful, very similar - https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs161/cs161.1168/lecture3.pdf",
      "This course was a sh!t-show. The profs running it (Petrick and Buss) are terrible at teaching. Classes were so empty at the end of the term that there were only 1-2 students in Buss's sections. Everyone else just decided to study off slides and CLRS. Marking was so late to be returned (it's Dec 29th and A5 marking isn't done; final marking hasn't even started) after TAs quit their jobs that the ISC (Sylvie, bless her heart) wrote a review on all the factors that went wrong. The assignments were long and hard. The exams were relatively less scary. There's a reason I'm posting this anonymously: I'm scared of retribution from these profs who shouldn't be teaching at Waterloo.",
      "You can pass this class easily if you are good at LeetCode (Blind 75 is sufficient). Never went to class (took this course on a coop term) and was still able to do well in the course.",
      "Leetcode course, you don't need to go to class to pass (but hard to get over 85)",
      "Had to retake it. Too hard for no reason. Please remodel this course because I know this is important and useful, just not structured properly enough. Things can go downhill so quick. And it has, for me.",
      "First part is basically Leetcode and then it goes into flow/np-completeness. Really enjoyed the content in both theoretical and practical contexts. Lap Chi gave us really good notes to study on. Final was tough.",
      "A difficult but good and useful course, Lap-Chi's notes are great for learning from.",
      "A lot of work for the assignments and the final was not easy by any means. I enjoyed the content though and it'll definitely be useful for interviews, etc",
      "Leetcode course. The concepts are super relevant, but there are also a lot of theories and proofs. The assignments, especially programming questions, are time consuming, but doable. The midterm was fair, but the final was brutal (with leetcode hard\u2026) and destroyed some students\u2019 confidence in passing the course. Luckily it was curved. Difficult course and not easy to get a good grade in, but I wouldn\u2019t have preferred it to be run any other way.",
      "Took this course in Winter 2023. There's not too much for me to say about this course other than the types of problems discussed (dynamic programming, graph algorithms, greedy algorithms, flows and cuts, etc.) were very interesting to learn and work with as opposed to problems encountered in prior courses, and the profs were very supportive throughout. I believe that the assignments, midterm, and final were all fair albeit on the more difficult side (especially the final). Spend good time on the assignments, really review the problems discussed in lectures, and everything should be okay.",
      "Most of the content is really useful for interviews. Hard assignments, start them as early as possible. If you put in the work, leetcode will become much easier.",
      "This course was a super helpful course for me in terms of building my confidence with solving algorithms problems. A lot of reviews say this course is just like Leetcode, but in my opinion there is a lot more nuance in the required solutions. Not only do you have to provide a solution, but you also need to prove correctness with some rigour. The content towards the end of the course gets quite abstract, so watch out. Some of the assignments were quite difficult, so make sure you start early, and go to office hours if you need help. Midterm and final were pretty straightforward, save for a couple of questions; a good tip is to study from the problems from the lectures, tutorials, and supplementary exercises and you should be golden.",
      "Make sure you start the assignments early. They are NOT ChatGPT-able for the most part, especially the programming ones, so don't even bank on that. NP-Complete proofs were new and pretty difficult but do a lot of them in case you run into one on the final. Both midterm and final were difficult but curves were applied to both. Didn't go to class and read off Lap Chi's notes.",
      "My professor made sure I didn't have to worry about marks. The content is tough but I didn't have to worry about marks. Learn as much as you can as the content will actually help you in the future. The final exam was better than the midterm, but our prof curved the midterm. Take it with Armin if you can.",
      "somewhat difficult course to cram but practicing problems every day and staying on track goes a long way",
      "Basically LeetCode as a course. Content didn't feel super interesting, but did feel pretty useful. Assignments were mostly pretty easy and very similar to problems we did in class. Midterm and exams were harder, but mostly just required cramming and memorizing a lot of content. For example, the midterm required that we know word for word about median of medians, Strassen's algorithm, and some problems from class. So long as you practice a lot you can probably get a pretty good grade since the content isn't that hard.",
      "Course is basically Leetcode until the NP-completeness part of the course.\nmost content does build upon previous topics so do not fall behind.\nMidterm questions and marking were fair\nAssignments were mostly bi-weekly with 1 programming question and some written questions, questions were of moderate difficulty though difficulty increases as course progresses.",
      "Quite literally the most useful course of this major and it's not even close. Leetcode medium and hard have never been so easy",
      "Course is a sleeper pick for hardest CS 3xx course, but very useful for Leetcode"

      "Great course that gives a good understanding of concurrent programming.  Assignments have a lot of repetition and boilerplate.",
      "This course in concept is very useful, however there is a great focus on language specific knowledge as well as memorization for exams. Would not recommend this course, take some online course instead.",
      "Be wary of minutia the midterm and final.",
      "Although it's a challenging course, many useful CS concepts are introduced. Make sure to start assignments early.",
      "The most convoluted handling of this topic I've ever seen. Concurrency is not a difficult topic, and I found myself going to google to learn essentially every topic covered in this course. The assignments are HORRIBLY worded to the point that reading the assignment takes longer than doing them. Honestly 350 gives you all the basic concurrency you need, if you're interested more just google around you will get a much better feel for the topic.",
      "Should take this as early as possible.",
      "Useful course that covers a lot of useful concepts. The assignments are extremely useful in understanding course content, although some were tough to debug. Midterm and final were not easy but fair game. \n\nAlso a really well organized course, tons of active participation on Piazza from the instructors. Many people complained that the assignments weren't clear enough but you are probably hearing it from the keeners who start assignments the day they are out. ",
      "I dropped it, but it was still a good course up until I realized I was going to fail :(",
      "The content is somewhat interesting - it at least opens your mind up to some new paradigms. The emphasis on a really odd code style (outdenting, for(;;), etc.) is a bit unfortunate. It would've been slightly more useful if a practical language was used instead of a pedagogical one (uC++).",
      "Most interesting course in the CS program. You will leard a lot of things, and if you thought you know a lot about threading, this course is likely to change that perception in the first few weeks. Make sure to take it only with Peter Buhr. Exams are really hard, though. And the assignments are long and difficult to debug, but you learn interesting concepts in the course. ",
      "Struggled quite a bit with this course. Debugging was HARD and assignments were challenging too. Not to mention uC++ has no resource outside of Waterloo (to my knowledge). But teaches you about very interesting CS topics that everyone should really know. ",
      "Make sure you pay attention in class and do all of the assignments! Also, follow the testing guidelines, it's really important to test properly in this course",
      "Assignments are fun and not too challenging",
      "While most of the theory taught in this course is useful, a large amount of time is devoted to \u03bcC++, an extension to C++ that appears to have no users outside Waterloo. Memorizing an API that you will never use again is a waste of time. This course could easily be taught with standard languages, and would be much improved.",
      "Interesting and useful course, but definitely not easy. Make sure to leave yourself enough time to do the assignments.",
      "Brought a lot of new light to concurrent programming that I thought I was good at before.",
      "Interesting course - thought it'd just be reviewing basic concepts, but they go in-depth on how concurrency is actually implemented at a low level, and the issues that can arise. Assignments take a lot of time, but they were fun. Biggest negative is uC++ - you'll lose serious marks if you don't memorize the syntax and peculiarities of this toy language that literally nobody uses for real work.",
      "I have to disagree with reviews complaining about the use of \u03bcC++ in this course. It is easier to understand and is more comprehensive than other languages or libraries (which are presented in lectures). It also has helpful and extensive documentation. The course is excellently organized, very interesting, and teaches general principles that are applicable to any concurrency paradigm.",
      "Very useful course that teaches a lot about concurrent programming, and also related topics such as control structure in programming languages, how exceptions are executed, hardware optimizations for concurrency, etc. There were 6 long assignments, taking much of your time, but they were all very interesting. Negatives: test documentations were super tedious, half of exam content was memorizing facts from the notes",
      "A lot of the most useful content of this course is already taught in OS.  Unfortunately, a lot of this course is about minutia of the uC++ teaching language. I understand why they use uC++: it's the only way they can teach that many concurrency structures in one language. What I don't like is how much time and test questions they spend on minutia of terminology and uC++. Also many of the structure taught aren't relevant outside of uC++ and maybe Ada.\n\nThere's some useful material in this course, but a lot of it isn't that useful or interesting.",
      "The concurrency side of this course is useful on its own, but as a side-effect, you will learn advanced control flow and likely come out of this a much better c++ programmer. This is one of those classes that can take either a little time or a ton of time depending on how good you are at debugging your code. Honestly, I think this course should be a degree requirement for BCS.",
      "Very involved course. It has extremely interesting assignments that some people found easy and others spent their whole life doing. Exams were mostly short answer/multiple choice memorizing/regurgitating slides, which I did not like. There were some interesting coding questions on the exams that went beyond the assignments in terms of difficulty, which I did like. \nEveryone liked Buhr!",

      "This was pretty hard!!!!",
      "Incredibly important course for anyone doing concurrent programming. Tough as nails though, with bugs being hell to debug.",
      "One of the most interesting courses I have taken at UW. The course uses an extension of C++ called uC++, which supports many types of concurrency constructs. Although uC++ is not used outside of this course, there are tons of important takeaways. I feel like this course really helped me mature as a programmer. Assignments can be a challenge, but are definitely worth the effort.",
      "Best course I've taken at UW. You learn a ton of useful material, and it's extremely well laid out. Assignments are difficult but if you start them early it's fine. Exams are very fair and Buhr will always give the previous 2 offerings' exams as samples to study off of.\n\nDo yourself a favour and take this course. Everything you do after CS350 is up to you, but you owe it to yourself to take this course.",
      "One of the worst courses I've ever taken. Peter Bhur is an incredible lecturer, but his concurrency methods are irrelevant. Most of what you will learn in this course is not used in practice, usually because they are too complicated/incomprehensible, but sometimes because it's just not how people implemented it. There's a lot of cool little facts you'll learn in the course, but most of them are just little tidbits of knowledge that you talk about with people to impress them (did you know C can handle most exceptions?), and aren't useful. I honestly don't believe I've learned anything RELEVANT about concurrency that I didn't know already.\n\n\nThe assignments in this course were the worst assignments I've ever had.  About 70-80% of the time spent working on them was spent building time wasting things like output generators or trying to parse what the assignment was even asking. None of the assignment questions were hard, they were just time consuming, in the worst way. There was also no opportunity for creativity in problem solving; you were told exactly what to do, and exactly how to do it (usually in very confusing language), and any deviation would lose you marks. \n\n\nThe marking on the assignments was insane. You will have marks taken off for things that aren't WRONG, but Buhr didn't do it that way, so you lose marks. You will lose marks for putting code in one perfectly reasonable place when Buhr put it somewhere else. You will lose marks for formatting your code differently that Buhr formats his code. I submitted an answer for a theoretical question once, in which you can come up with two different answers depending on how your interpret the problem, and submitted a full proof, and I got 30% on the question because Buhr got the other answer. They didn't say or explain why they thought my proof was wrong; I was simply wrong because Buhr did it another way. \n\n\nWe also need to talk about micro C++. This is Buhr's language that he designed for concurrency, but nobody uses, except for this course. You'll quickly learn there are very good reasons nobody uses the language. The syntax is pretty bad, and there is essentially no documentation or help out there except for the documentation Buhr has. The language also has it's share of errors and bugs, which Buhr will most likely find throughout the term. I have counted 11 errors in the language that were solved by just remaking. \n\n\nIn the end, I feel sad about this course. Concurrency is a very interesting topic, and Buhr is honestly the best lecturer I've ever had. If he took that passion and applied it to teaching useful things, and let someone else make and mark the assignments, I could have really loved this course. But as it stands, I would strongly suggest you don't take this course unless you absolutely have to. You'll learn more about concurrency from trying to build an Android app or making a toy concurrent system that you'll ever learn from this course.\n",
      "One of the best courses I've taken at UW.",
      "Long assignments, only spent 1% of the time thinking about concurrency, the rest of the time was spent debugging obscure micro c++ details. The course also spent a great deal of time discussing some of the less relevant parts of concurrency, at least in terms of how most people will use it. That's fine and all, but it's only useful-ish. Pretty much everything was already covered in the operating systems course, so basically this course only adds a couple new concurrency styles (ex. actors) and goes deeper into locks.",
      "Peter Buhr is a great prof, but I think I would've gotten a lot more out of this course if it was taught without uC++. I do still recommend taking it, as you do learn quite a lot, but I am quite disappointed I didn't come out learning anything industry-standard.",
      "Concepts aren't that difficult, but the assignments can be\u2014particularly if you're not great with C++. Familiarity with C++ can be the difference between passing and failing this course unfortunately.",
      "I told my friend this course was going to be useless. He kept telling me \"it'll get more interesting later...\" IT. DID. NOT. GET. ANY. MORE. INTERESTING. The prof is good, but the content will never be used outside of theoretical CS. Also, the grading is harsh and you're often left wondering why you got something wrong (very little feedback, and they take lots of points off for code style without giving you a style guide).",
      "I took this course thinking it would lead to useful concepts and real world applications. Little did I know that the prof makes you learn his own made-up language for the entirety of the course. At one point he was teaching a concept in class and bragged it only existed in his language (full coroutines). Half of the course content will leave you wondering why your time is being wasted learning this junk. The other half is covered in CS 350. The assignments are a little long, mostly extended by the fact that a large chunk of your time will be dedicated to trying to decipher what he actually wants you to do from the assignment outline. On piazza the prof and even the TAs are so intentionally obtuse and condescending to the point where you wonder if they have a bet going on who can be the worst. If I hear this guy say \"automagically\" one more time I'm going to lose my mind. This is the only course I've written a UW Flow review for, as it's by far the worst CS course I've taken in undergrad so far. If you're in CS, I wouldn't take this course if I were you. If you're in SE, I'd consider switching to CS.",
      "The worst CS course I've taken at Waterloo. If you are in CS then please choose literally any other 3rd/4th year cs course. If you are in SE and are forced to take CS 343 then you have my condolences.",
      "Since no language implements all of the concurrency constructs taught in the course, the course is instead taught using uC++, a custom version of C++ that is absolute hell to debug. The assignments also expect you to implement argument parsing and error-checking and provide extensive testing documentation. Therefore, even though the course is *supposed* to teach concurrency, 50% of it ends up being uC++ trivia or programming/debugging code unrelated to the actual course material.",
      "TLDR, I like it but I don't want to take it. I.E., the assignments and midterm/final exams are marked harshly. I don't think they reflect well on what I learned in this course.\n\n\nWith all due respect, this content is interesting and probably useful to some extent. However, since it is all about uC++, it is not so practical.\n\nOn the other hand, grading is just ridiculous. There are many ways you can lose points. For example, an inconsistent indentation or a \"wrong\" naming will result in a \"-5\", and the total score for the assignment is usually around 100.\n\nThe professors are very passionate (especially Mr. Buhr), and I wouldn't doubt that. But most of the answers they answered on Piazza were not helpful at all (especially Mr. Buhr).\n\nBasically, these lectures are just documentation about what uC++ is and why it is the way it is. So, after you watched (went to) all the lectures, you will find that the content itself is not that difficult. However, you can still spend a lot of time debugging it, because there are some pitfalls in uC++ if you don't pay attention (some of them are a.k.a. \"the known issues\" to the teaching team but not students). Also, since uC++ is based on C++, you know that debugging some issues can be very time-consuming.\n\nIn addition to that, you will spend a lot of time writing or debugging code that has absolutely nothing to do with concurrency, because the assignments will always require you to handle special inputs. You should be very careful with this part because if your program doesn't handle all the invalid inputs correctly, you will probably fail the assignment (even though they say the testing part does not worth much in marking, which is a lie). This makes me feel it is a \"practical\" testing course.\n\nIf you don't need to take this class (not from SE), then please don't take it. After all, what they teach in this class will have little (if any) impact on how you code in the future. But I have to admit, I did enjoy it. However, if you ask me if I would have taken this course if I knew what it was like, then I definitely would not take it. ",
      "A challenging, useful, and interesting course in concurrency and control flow.\n\nThe assignments are some of the hardest in the CS department (biweekly and easily 20-30 hours each, if you make no mistakes and understand all the content perfectly).\n\nA lot of people complain about uC++. However, this course is taught in uC++ because no other language has all the concurrency mechanisms that uC++ has (uC++ is just a teaching language). After taking this course, you're able to write concurrent programs in a number of different languages (C++, Go, Rust, Java, ...) because of all the different mechanisms used.\n\nThis course also requires a high level of attention to detail in the code itself (both on code style and functionality).\n\nThis course should be required for all CS undergraduates.",
      "This course has ruined how I feel about queues, bathrooms, sodas, and so much more. My friends think I am slightly deranged now. I walk up to the William's in the Plaza and someone lets me go ahead and I back off at the same time and I go \"holy shit this is just like livelocks from CS343\". Then someone walks in front of both of us and I go \"holy shit this just like barging from CS343\". Then I talk to my friends and they stop saying what they were saying to talk to me and I'm like \"holy shit this is just like raising an exception to another task in\"\n\n10/10 would recommend.",
      "Really makes you learn everything about concurrency. Some people think learning uC++ is useless, but since other languages don't implement most of the concurrency features it lets you learn about everything. Only take this course if you actually want to learn about concurrency otherwise it's not worth the effort - assignments are killer, exams are easier comparatively but still difficult. Take it with Peter, it's his course and he's a great lecturer, it's just not the same without him. 2 person final project. "

      "Take this course seriously. If you treat it like a bird course, you won't do very well (70s-80s), but if you spend the same amount of time as your other courses it's easy to get high 90s. You experience proper software development. Kotlin is the language used and Kotlin sucks. There will be a lot of problems with your project. Go to Jeff for help, he's a very very good and friendly prof.",

      "Using Kotlin & JavaFX for desktop app development is kinda questionable. Even though this course does give you lot of spaces on design and how you implement each feature, the tech stack really limited its usefulness for job searching or career development.",
      "The course is pretty well structured. Although Jeff encourages you to use JavaFX, he does give groups quite a bit of freedom and you are okay to use alternatives (as long as you get his consent). Do be warned though, Jeff suggests the tech stack he does because he has personally vetted it.\n\nOne thing I adored about this course is that you can make it as difficult or as easy as you would like. I know some groups who just did the easiest project and implemented the minimum features necessary and I also know other groups who built something unique. In terms of marks, this course is pretty easy to get an 80+ in. However, if you want to get an absurdly high mark then you need to put in quite a bit of time a week.",

In addition to the fact that we used DB2, it was very poorly set up and every execution of my program took like 5 minutes since  we needed to connect to the DB to compile our static SQL. This was at least a day or two before the deadline, too. Poor experience, and otherwise a bird course.",

      "I came into the course with no SQL experience, so it was fairly useful in an introduction to that (even though I could have just as easily learned it by myself online). The rest of the topics are pretty dull and you will probably hate the normalization stuff. The exams are nothing like the assignments and the course has terrible management. There was very little communication about things, everything was announced in class. I can't see myself recommending this course unless you need a slot filled with a relatively simple CS course.",
      "Pretty straight forward if you've done any database work before, and if you have, this gives some foundation of the theory behind it. I've been asked so many times to explain normalization in interviews, and this course taught me what I needed to know to answer their questions!",

They also lost one of my assignments because they missed it in the dropbox and I believe they took off late marks when it was in early.",

Assignments were pretty simple but felt like they were just write offs, like you could do them without knowing the course. Final was super obscure content, including stuff we didn't know. Lectures were hard to follow since our professor was so monotone, and he used audio files to teach, which becomes hard to match up with visuals.

This course has 4 assignments at 20% each and 5 quizzes at 4% each. A1-A3 is desktop based and A4 is Android development, although this may change in the future to be fully android. The biggest downside of this course is that there isn't enough time to cover everything, so A4 tends to be quite tough since android is generally tough to do. The quizzes are pretty standard and are really just there for confirming knowledge. I would take this course if you're interested in learning about how to build better UI's and get familiar with modern development stacks like Kotlin",

I should have gotten a better mark in this class but I'm a dumb ass and ended up skipping 20% of the graded work. I think as long as you spend good time on your assignments (especially reserve time for A1 and A4), it will be a good experience, and the actual theory was interesting to learn about.\n\nI will say though, this course really needs to be revamped to have modern technologies (Kotlin is good, but who uses JavaFX nowadays???) and I personally think the course should shift more towards web/app development rather than desktop development (with A4 being the exception)",
      "Kind of useless. Even if you're a frontend dev, it's mostly useless, since they teach JavaFX for most of the course.",
      "Although the contents can be dull sometimes, they are mostly intuitive. The assignments are time consuming and except the last one (Android app), probably aren't relevant to the industry. But they are pretty rewarding when you finish. Quizzes and the exam are reasonable. Very easy to get a high mark in. Another note is that, the specific technology they use to teach the course have changed quite a lot over the years. We learned JavaFX and a little bit of Android at the end. You may get something different in the future.",

Require you to follow the lectures. BUT, I did not find them hard because they were enjoyable. They were a breadth of fresh air compared to other CS coursework and assignments.

The keys to succeeding in this course are good time management skills, a deep understanding of the C memory model and the O.S. memory models taught in this course, and judicious application of the GDB debugger.

You learn how to deal with problems that you previously didn't know existed, like how to schedule threads to run so that they appear concurrent, or how to manage virtual memory to reduce fragmentation and speed up memory translations.

It being open book makes it a lot more easier to do most of the stuff, but this is a TIME CONSUMING COURSE. The course concepts are NOT DIFFICULT per say, but it takes a lot of time to code the projects and whatnot. \n\n",

The course takes place in a submarine called \"Mathematics and Computer (MC)\", where selected students will be awarded \"Ring 0 Permission\" to guide the power of multithreading. You will play a mysterious character named \"kernel\". During your travels, you will encounter numerous user programs with different personalities and unique abilities. Together with them, you will defeat race conditions and recover leaked memory. At the same time, you will gradually discover the truth of \"OS/161\".",

Its pretty doable if you manage your time well and allocate the time the course needs, usually 70% of the assignment is super easy to obtain but the rest might take a while so make sure to make tradeoffs when necesarry. For the midterm, SEE THE PAST MIDTERMS! Especially the memory based questions, you might just get lucky and get a very similar question. Also, v v imp that you understand how locks, cvs, and semaphores are implemented since they can ask you to modify their implementation to get specific functionality. For the final, just understand concepts well, about the same difficulty as the midterm. Lastly, watch leslies S21 videos if you dont understand anything the content covered is the exact same! ",

Take it with Rob, he's a fantastic prof. His lectures keep you on your toes and feel super personalized. He'll pause mid-sentence and wait for someone to give him the answer, just to keep everyone thinking about the content being covered.

The assignments are hard but really help with understanding (+ they give hints to make them easier).",

I think I learnt stuff in the lectures though. Nice stuff -- just um very interesting course structure, not necessarily in a good way. Never had one quite like this before. Rob Hackman ruined my experience though. Feel free to read my review of him under the Prof Reviews. Mine starts with \"I see CS bros worship him.\" So happy this is apparently potentially his last time teaching it.",

Assignments aren't too bad if you start them early enough. Midterm was fair besides one question where you literally had to memorize MIPS documentation to do??. The final was BRUTAL, I've never been so violated in my life.",
      "Great course because of assignments and the textbook Three Easy Pieces. As far as the delivery... it was okay. The instructors wrote an unfair final and gave us very little information to prepare. It blows me away how much money we pay for the amount of effort we get in return from instructors. \n\nQuite honestly, and this pertains to all courses and not just CS350, the quality is lower than courses I have taken for a hundredth of the price.\n\n",
      "The course got me confused af. Should have more quizez/in class problems/tutorials, cuz the assignments are rly disconnected from the course content. Slides are kinda confusing and tries to include too much information in too few words. \n\nAli knows a lot of stuff. He can answer any kind of weird question you have. It's just we're too dumb. Makes me realize MIT of the North is just a meme. (But seriously, I feel he should try to think in our shoes and explain things in simpler words.)\n\nIf you take it with Ali, I recommend reading things ahead then asking him questions in person. I should have done that.\n\nHitting the like because of the massive curve. ",

The content of this course is quite interesting yet difficult to fully grasp, and the lectures themselves (had Rob Hackman - it's his last term here) were engaging and decent overall in teaching quality. However, the midterm was challenging, and the final was so brutal that it was unfair for the students.\n\nThe entire course is unfair, actually, because the course delivery and administration is just absolute garbage. There is ZERO practice material for the final (your OS161 assignments are almost completely irrelevant for them, actually) and ZERO tutorials for this course. The way that this course is taught needs to be revamped entirely (maybe the people responsible for this can take a lesson from CS241...) so that students can actually properly absorb and engage with the content.",

I kid u not everyone I asked thought they got below a 50% on the final so yea.",
      "Debugging takes a lot of time but the assignments are very interesting.",
      "Pretty much impossible to decipher the slides on your own without going to classes. Final was on things that were never taught and Ali designed it expecting students to have a 50. Ended up giving a huge bump tho so everyone finished it fine, just gave lots of anxiety along the way. Piazza support was close to none. ",
      "If you disregard the final, this course was honestly free. Assignments had literal step by step instructions on what to do so as long as you don't overthink it then you'll be fine for the assignments. Also the assignments are basically the same from term to term so if you just Google for CS350 git repos you'll find other people's code but you didn't hear that from me. Overall, the course gives a good high level overview of OS but the content at the end (file systems + devices) felt hastily put together and a bit outdated. The terminology used like \"killing children\" keeps the course fun :)\n\nFinal was brutal and completely unfair (50% was based on 2 papers that we were supposed to read that had little to do with course content)",
      "Assignments are 15+ pages of step by step instructions, you don\u2019t even have to know how to code to do them, much less know any of the course content. On one hand, they\u2019re incredibly easy, on the other hand, they offer no value in terms of practicing. assignments were constantly released late and riddled with typos that fundamentally changed what the questions were asking, and Ali and Rob never bothered to check the piazza. The slides are in awful and filled with errors, so good luck  reviewing off of them. This course was a gong show ",
      "The Winter 2023 offering was one of my worst experiences in undergrad. We had a 25 page exam in which we hand-wrote OS code in C on one of the questions, and it was the easiest question. We also had a 10% reading assignment of two research papers, which were never marked and showed up in their entireties on the final. We also had two professors who routinely ignored the class Piazza (\"We've been reading your questions but we didn't deem any of the questions good enough to respond to them\"), and had to be called out to communicate anything about assignments or assessments at all. One of the worst organized courses I've ever taken.",

The assignments were challenging and was where I did a fair bit of my learning, while the quizzes were really easy. Office hours were great. Midterm and final exams were in-person and pretty doable if you understood the key content. The professor could have tested us on tedious procedures and memorization but he didn't and I appreciate that. The format was good; no major complaints.\n\nThe content was a little disappointing but still interesting for me: disappointing because I thought it would be more applicable to real-world uses but a lot of the class is only concerned about computability and not practicality (we care that an algorithm exists for X problem, but we don't care if it runs in O(n^n^n^n^n^n) time). It was interesting though to learn about the hierarchy of languages and finally understand how people can prove that something is not computable (that is, even if we had infinite computing resources, we could not solve some problem; I always wondered how we could know that). This module made an interesting complement to CS 341 which I was taking concurrently.\n\nOverall, I think it's a course worth taking for a richer understanding of computability, but perhaps not if you are only concerned with software engineering and practical stuff. Also, you need to have some patience for formal reasoning and proof writing because that's basically what you'll be doing throughout the course.",

This course covers several models of computation, such as DFAs, NFAs, PDAs, regexes, context-free grammars, Turing machines and NTMs. You analyze what languages they recognize, and what languages they don't.

That also means you rarely have to do rigorous proofs - maybe that's what CS371 is for. \n\nMidterm and exam were both quite easy this term, despite the horror stories I've heard from previous terms.

Not a big problem tho.",

None of the concepts were especially difficult, but they also didn't feel like you were learning something truly new. There were 5 pretty easy assignments that were all application, but at least the applications were usually quite cool. The midterm and exam were much more difficult with some more theoretical questions, so definitely make sure to study well despite being able to bring a cheatsheet.",

I still liked it overall but it felt somewhat pointless since all of the content can easily be learned online. The final was also very numerical (not code-based), which is the opposite of the assignments...",

      "Free course and super interesting. Whole course is basically how to use computers to do math. Assignments are made to be super interesting (each assignment had a forensic/crime-solving element to it) and they're usually copy and paste from a previous term's assignments.

You learnt how to provide software requirements, including drawing use case diagrams, state machine diagrams, domain model diagrams, sequence diagrams, etc. Basically, you learnt a lot of higher-level knowledge. I do think this inspired me to think more before delivering code. Therefore, this is a 5/5 useful course for me. Additionally, this course is usually a group work course, and you need to write a book eventually. For the last deliverable, our group gave a 76-page report.

The second one was much harder since you had to actually figure out how to implement functions for a distributed file system.

The assignment only relies on two lectures but is worth 40% of the grade. More importantly, it's a cumulative assignment without tutorials, so 1 bug can literally kill your assignment mark. The written assignments are pretty simple but can be a little unclear, as they require you to look in the textbook (not really a problem) or do your own research. \n\nI would take this course if you're super passionate, but otherwise, there are way better courses to take. I would honestly take this course if they had tutorials to go over assignment details. ",

It was mainly a3 that was a bit of a time sink, so make sure to get started early. It's more the debugging aspect that takes time, than the actual implementation. A2 was trivial once you figure out the basic implementation of a single call (the rest are all minor changes). A1 and a4 were pretty straightforward written assignments based on things discussed in class. No midterm so that was fun, but there was lots of stuff to cover for the final. If you're taking the course with Khuzaima, make sure to attend every single lecture, extra points if you audio record it for future use. Also, he basically gives the major exam topics for the final in the last lecture, so definitely attend that and focus on getting those topics revised first. Lastly, office hours were very useful for assignments, make sure to attend if you're stuck. The TAs are knowledgeable and helpful!"

The course is not very structured except the general 'modules' but within each module you jump from topic to topic with no real focus. The assignments have 2 parts, programming and written, with the programming part being quite difficult.

The material regularly involves upper-year optimization/statistics content which is only covered in 1 or 2 review lectures at the beginning. With Yaoliang, the material was very theoretical and mathematical, and I only understood 50% of the content --- enough to have an intuitive understanding of the concepts, but not enough to really understand all of the proofs presented in the lectures. Fortunately, this was enough to get a grade of 90+. For the students who want to go further and gain a deeper understanding, the professor was very helpful in answering questions and providing pointers/resources on Piazza.",

There certainly was mentions of complex mathematical and statistics concepts that had not been previously taught but none of that really came up in the assignments. If you actually want a strong grasp of the content, then you are in for a hell of a time, otherwise you're probably fine. The assignments were pretty separated from the lectures, and contained more than enough context.The final project was a kaggle competition that was really fun. We also did not have a midterm or final, but I think that was more the exception than the norm.

The prof is really nice, me and my friend always ask him 30+min after class even our questions seem very stupid. The final project of the Kaggle competition is doable even you studied no course notes (google + youTube + pytorch doc for me).

      "I took Computing and Discrimination with Maura & Dan in its first iteration. The chosen material was really interesting and relevant and it was great to hear everyone's experiences. The different class sections differed pretty drastically in experience though, the goals of the weekly papers remained unclear to me throughout the term, and the TA feedback was frustrating.",
      "Computing and discrimination was alright. I think it really depends on how interested you are in the content. The name is exactly what the course is about. There's a lot of reading to do, and there's a good amount of papers to write as well. About a thousand words ever two weeks on average although there's plenty of flexibility. The final project was pretty fun and was left open to students to pick an project and idea that was related to the course content.",
